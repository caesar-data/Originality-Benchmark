  "content": "**TRUE**: The statement that human babies are born with the ability to detect sour tastes is factually correct. This conclusion is supported by extensive evidence from developmental biology, which shows the gustatory system is functionally mature before birth, and from neonatal studies, which document characteristic and differential facial expressions in newborns when exposed to sour stimuli[1][2][3].\n\n## Physiological and Fetal Development\n\nThe biological structures required for taste, including the detection of sour stimuli, are developed and functional prior to birth[4][5].\n\n*   **Timeline of Development**: The development of the gustatory system begins early in gestation[3]. Taste bud formation starts around the 7th to 8th week of gestation[6][7][8]. Nerve fibers approach the lingual epithelium between the 6th and 7th week, penetrating it and forming synapses by the 8th week[9]. The taste papillae are considered functionally mature by the beginning of the second trimester[4]. By 13 to 15 weeks, the taste cells resemble their mature form, and typical taste pores are present by the 14th week, allowing the taste buds to begin their gustatory function[9][8]. Fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid begins around 12 weeks of gestation, allowing the fetus to experience tastes[8][10]. Activation of these taste buds starts around the 30th week of gestation, stimulated by variations in the composition of the amniotic fluid based on the mother's diet[6][11]. By the time of birth, newborns possess a fully functional taste receptor system[3].\n\n*   **Sour Taste Receptors**: The detection of sour taste is mediated by specific receptors. Sourness is perceived in response to free hydrogen ions (acids)[6]. Type III taste bud cells are identified as the sour detectors[12]. Detection occurs via proton-sensitive ion channels, with specific candidates including PKD2L1 and OTOP1[3][14].\n\n## Behavioral Evidence in Newborns\n\nStudies conducted on newborn infants (neonates) hours after birth provide direct behavioral evidence that they can detect and discriminate sour tastes[2]. The innate ability to react to sour stimuli is a well-documented phenomenon reflecting the basic biology of human infants[1][15].\n\n*   **Characteristic Facial Expressions**: When presented with sour-tasting solutions like citric acid, newborns exhibit a distinct and characteristic set of negative facial expressions[1]. Pioneering studies by Steiner observed that sour solutions elicited squinting and lip pursing[1]. Subsequent research confirmed these findings, identifying lip pursing as a major and differential response to sour tastes, often accompanied by actions in the brow and mid-face region[16][17][18]. Other observed reactions include grimacing, nose wrinkling, and head shaking[19][8].\n\n*   **Taste Discrimination**: Newborns not only detect sourness but can also differentiate it from other tastes[16][17]. Their facial reactions to sour stimuli are distinct from their responses to other tastes[1]. For example, sour solutions elicit lip pursing, whereas bitter solutions typically cause mouth gaping, and sweet solutions lead to facial relaxation and sucking motions[16][17]. This demonstrates that the gustatory system is functional and capable of discrimination within hours of birth[2]. This innate rejection of sour and bitter tastes, along with a preference for sweet, is considered a fundamental aspect of infant biology[1][20].",

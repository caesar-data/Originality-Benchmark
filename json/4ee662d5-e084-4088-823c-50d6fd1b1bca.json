  "content": "FALSE. The statement that the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed 9 civil charges against Kraken CEO Jesse Powell is factually incorrect on multiple grounds. The DOJ conducted a *criminal* investigation that it closed *without filing any charges*. Separately, other federal agencies have brought civil enforcement actions against the company Kraken, not Jesse Powell personally, and none of the provided documentation substantiates the number of nine charges.\n\n## Department of Justice (DOJ) Criminal Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded a multi-year *criminal* investigation into Jesse Powell, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, without filing any charges[1][2]. The probe, which began in 2023, was unrelated to Kraken's crypto operations[2]. Instead, it centered on a management dispute and allegations of \"hacking and cyber-stalking\" related to the Verge Center for the Arts, a Sacramento-based nonprofit organization Powell co-founded[4].\n\nThe key outcomes of the federal investigation were:\n*   **No Charges Filed**: Federal prosecutors formally closed the investigation and confirmed that no criminal action would proceed[1][2][5].\n*   **Declination Letter**: Powell's legal team received a formal \"declination letter\" from the DOJ, a document officially confirming the case's closure[2][6].\n*   **Return of Seized Devices**: Dozens of electronic devices, including laptops and mobile phones seized during a 2023 FBI raid on Powell's home, were returned to him[1][4][7].\n\nWhile the federal criminal matter is closed, Powell is actively pursuing his own *civil* lawsuit against board members of the Verge Center for the Arts, alleging they conspired to unlawfully remove him[1][5].\n\n## Civil Actions by Other Federal Agencies\n\nWhile the DOJ did not file civil charges against Powell, his company, Kraken, has faced civil enforcement actions from other U.S. regulators. This may be a source of confusion.\n\n### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nThe SEC has filed civil complaints against the Kraken exchange.\n*   **November 2023 Lawsuit**: The SEC sued Kraken, alleging it operated as an unregistered securities broker, clearing agency, and dealer, and that it commingled customer and corporate funds[8][9]. Kraken denied the allegations and stated its intent to defend its position in court[10][11].\n*   **February 2023 Settlement**: Prior to the lawsuit, Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million penalty to the SEC and cease its crypto staking-as-a-service program for U.S. customers to settle charges of failing to register the offer and sale of that program[10][12]. Powell publicly criticized the SEC for filing a new lawsuit months after this settlement[10][11].\n\n### Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nThe CFTC has also taken civil action against Kraken.\n*   **2021 Penalty**: The CFTC imposed a $1.25 million civil monetary penalty on Kraken for offering a prohibited margined retail commodity trading service to U.S. customers[13][14][15].\n\n## Unsubstantiated Number of Charges\n\nThere is no information in the provided materials to support the claim of \"9 civil charges.\" Research into legal cases involving a \"Powell\" revealed several unrelated individuals, including:\n*   **Sidney Powell**: A lawyer who initially faced seven felony counts in Georgia related to the 2020 election and later pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges[16][17].\n*   **Jerome Powell**: The Chair of the Federal Reserve who was referred to the DOJ by a member of Congress for a criminal investigation over alleged perjury, but has not been charged with any crime[18][19].\n\nThe legal actions involving Kraken's Jesse Powell are limited to the now-closed DOJ criminal investigation (no charges) and civil actions from the SEC and CFTC directed at his company, Kraken[1][8][15].",

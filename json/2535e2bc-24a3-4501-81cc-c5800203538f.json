  "content": "**FALSE**: The statement contains multiple inaccuracies regarding the drone model, flight duration, record status, and the hurricane's classification.\n\nA detailed analysis of the claim's core components reveals the following discrepancies:\n\n### Drone Model and Agency\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does utilize uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, for hurricane reconnaissance[1][2]. However, the specific model deployed for these missions is the **Altius-600**, not the Altius-400[4][5]. The Altius-600 is a 27-pound UAS with an eight-foot wingspan, designed by Area-I (now part of Anduril Industries) in collaboration with NOAA to gather data in environments too dangerous for crewed aircraft[1][6][4].\n\n### Flight Duration and Record Status\n\nThe claim of a \"record 75 minutes\" is incorrect on two counts. First, the flight duration was significantly longer, and second, the record has since been surpassed by a different drone.\n\n*   **Altius-600 Flight Duration in Hurricane Ian**: On September 28, 2022, an Altius-600 drone launched from a NOAA WP-3D Orion \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft flew for approximately two hours (120 minutes) inside Hurricane Ian[2][7][8]. This specific flight set what was then a Guinness World Record for the longest endurance flight inside a tropical cyclone at **102 minutes**[9][10][11].\n*   **Current World Record**: The record set by the Altius-600 has been broken. On September 25, 2024, a Black Swift S0 drone flew for **105 minutes** inside Hurricane Helene, establishing the new official Guinness World Record[12][14].\n\n### Hurricane Category Reassessment\n\nThe statement that the flight occurred in a \"category 4 hurricane\" is misleading. The Altius-600 mission took place in Hurricane Ian on September 28, 2022[15].\n\n*   **Operational vs. Post-Analysis Classification**: At the time of the flight, Hurricane Ian was operationally classified as a high-end Category 4 storm[16][17]. It made landfall near Cayo Costa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph, consistent with a Category 4 rating[18][19].\n*   **Official Upgrade to Category 5**: A post-storm reanalysis conducted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) concluded that Hurricane Ian had briefly reached **Category 5** intensity, with peak winds of 160 mph, at 12:00 UTC on September 28, 2022, while over the Gulf of Mexico[20][21][22]. The storm weakened slightly back to a high-end Category 4 before making landfall later that day[21]. Therefore, the drone flew through a storm system that was a Category 5 at its peak intensity on that day[11].",

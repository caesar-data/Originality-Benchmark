  "content": "FALSE: While a research project perfectly matching this description exists, it was not developed by researchers at MIT[1]. The technology described appears to be a misattribution of the \"ActiveErgo\" system, which was developed by researchers primarily affiliated with National Taiwan University and Texas A&M University[1].\n\n## Analysis of Relevant Research\n\n### The ActiveErgo Project (Non-MIT)\n\nThe system described in the query aligns precisely with the **ActiveErgo** project, detailed in a 2018 paper presented at the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems[2].\n\n*   **Functionality**: ActiveErgo is described as the first active approach to improving ergonomics by combining sensing with the actuation of motorized furniture[2]. The prototype system uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to perform skeletal sensing and monitoring of the user[3][1].\n*   **Automatic Adjustment**: Based on the skeletal tracking data, the system determines the ideal furniture positions for the specific user and automatically adjusts the computer monitor, desk, and chair to conform to recommended ergonomics guidelines[3]. The system measures seven body dimensions, such as torso, upper arm, and lower leg length, to calculate personalized workspace settings[1].\n*   **Affiliation**: The authors of the \"ActiveErgo\" paper are affiliated with National Taiwan University, the University of Toronto, and Texas A&M University, with no mention of MIT[1].\n\n### Related Furniture and Actuation Research at MIT\n\nResearch conducted at MIT labs, such as the Media Lab and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), has explored advanced concepts in furniture and robotics, but none match the specific functionality of posture-based height adjustment for ergonomics.\n\n*   **TRANSFORM (MIT Media Lab)**: This project is a shape-changing desk composed of over 1,000 motorized pins that can move up and down to create dynamic 3D shapes on the tabletop[4][5]. The table's surface can react to hand gestures, creating ripples, or be programmed to display 3D animations[4]. Its purpose is to explore shape-display technology as an interactive medium, not to adjust its overall height for user ergonomics[6].\n*   **Ori Robotic Furniture (MIT Media Lab spin-off)**: Originating from the Media Lab's \"CityHome\" project, Ori is a robotic furniture system designed for micro-apartments[7]. It consists of a single L-shaped unit that can slide along a track to transform a small space into a bedroom, office, or living room[8]. This system reconfigures a room's layout rather than adjusting individual furniture pieces for real-time ergonomic support[7].\n*   **AutoSaw (MIT CSAIL)**: This is a robot-assisted carpentry system that enables non-experts to customize furniture designs via a CAD interface[9]. Once a design for a chair or desk is finalized, robots perform the high-risk cutting tasks[10]. AutoSaw is focused on the custom fabrication of furniture, not the subsequent real-time actuation of completed pieces[11].\n*   **Mediated Atmospheres (MIT Media Lab)**: This smart office project uses biosensors and machine learning to personalize the sensory environment of a workspace, including lighting, sound, and visual projections, to enhance focus or reduce stress[12]. The system adjusts the surrounding atmosphere but does not physically actuate furniture[12].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe claim that MIT researchers developed a smart table that automatically adjusts its height based on user posture is false. A system with this exact capability, called ActiveErgo, was developed, but the responsible institutions were National Taiwan University and Texas A&M University. While MIT has conducted extensive research into robotic and adaptive furniture, their notable projects in this area have focused on different applications, such as shape-shifting surfaces, room reconfiguration, and automated construction, rather than real-time ergonomic adjustment based on posture.",

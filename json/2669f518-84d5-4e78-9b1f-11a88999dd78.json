  "content": "**TRUE**: At the time it occurred, July 2023 was unequivocally declared the planet's hottest month on record by a consensus of the world's leading climate monitoring agencies, shattering previous records by a significant margin[1][2][3][4]. Subsequent analysis of 2024 data has created a more complex picture: some datasets now rank July 2024 as marginally warmer, while others show July 2023 retaining the record or the two months being in a statistical tie[5][6][7]. The minor differences between datasets are within the margin of statistical error, and the overarching scientific conclusion is that both months were exceptionally and unprecedentedly hot, reflecting an accelerating long-term warming trend[5].\n\n## July 2023: A Unanimous Record-Shattering Month\n\nIn mid-2023, major global climate authorities\u2014including the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014all confirmed that July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded in their respective datasets[9]. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which synthesizes these datasets, corroborated this finding[4][10].\n\n### Key Metrics for July 2023\n*   **Copernicus (C3S):** The global average surface air temperature was 16.95\u00b0C[11][12][13]. This was 0.72\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for July and a substantial 0.33\u00b0C warmer than the previous record-holder, July 2019[14]. The temperature was estimated to be approximately 1.5\u00b0C warmer than the pre-industrial average (1850-1900)[14][15]. Based on proxy data, scientists suggested the month may have been the warmest in 120,000 years[15][16].\n*   **NOAA:** The global surface temperature was 1.12\u00b0C (2.02\u00b0F) above the 20th-century average, making it the warmest July in NOAA\u2019s 174-year record[2][17]. Since July is climatologically the planet's warmest month of the year, NOAA concluded July 2023 was likely Earth's warmest month on record[18][17].\n*   **NASA:** Analysis from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) confirmed July 2023 was hotter than any other month in its record, which dates to 1880[3][19]. The temperature was 1.18\u00b0C (2.12\u00b0F) warmer than the 1951-1980 baseline average for July and 0.24\u00b0C (0.43\u00b0F) warmer than any previous July in NASA's records[20][19][21].\n\nThis record-breaking month was part of a larger trend that led 2023 to be confirmed as the hottest year on record[22][23][24]. July and August 2023 were the two warmest months ever recorded at that time[25][26].\n\n## The Challenge from July 2024: A Statistical Split\n\nThe status of July 2023 as the single hottest month ever was challenged by temperatures recorded in July 2024. However, analyses from different agencies yielded slightly different conclusions, highlighting the nuances of global temperature measurement.\n\n*   **NOAA:** Reported July 2024 as the new warmest July on record, 0.03\u00b0C (0.05\u00b0F) warmer than July 2023[27][5].\n*   **Copernicus (C3S):** Found July 2024 to be the second-warmest July on record, just 0.04\u00b0C cooler than July 2023[5][28].\n*   **NASA:** Initially reported that July 2024 had a \"narrow edge\" over July 2023[6][29]. A subsequent ensemble analysis concluded that the difference between the two months is smaller than the data's uncertainty, rendering them \"effectively tied for hottest\"[6].\n*   **Berkeley Earth:** Concluded that July 2024 and July 2023 are \"tied for the warmest July\" since records began in 1850[7]. Their analysis found a nominal difference of only 0.002\u00b0C, which is statistically insignificant[7].\n\nThe WMO acknowledged these minor discrepancies, stating the differences between the datasets are within the statistical margin of error used for these calculations[5].\n\n## Understanding the Discrepancies\n\nThe small differences in rankings between these \"gold-standard\" datasets stem from distinct methodologies for analyzing global temperature.\n\n*   **Data Models:** Copernicus uses a \"reanalysis\" method based on its ERA5 climate model, which combines forecasts with billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations to create a comprehensive, near real-time picture of the climate[5]. In contrast, NASA and NOAA primarily rely on direct observational data from land and sea-based weather stations, using statistical analysis to fill in gaps[30].\n*   **Ocean Measurements:** The datasets may differ in how they measure temperature over the ocean. Reanalysis data may use air temperatures above the ocean surface, whereas observational datasets often use sea surface temperature readings from the water itself. Water warms and cools more slowly than air, which can introduce slight variations[31].\n*   **Data Gap Infilling:** Agencies use different techniques to estimate temperatures in areas with sparse data coverage, such as the polar regions, which can lead to minor differences in the global average[32].\n\nDespite these methodological differences, all major datasets are in strong agreement on the overall long-term warming trend and the exceptional nature of the heat experienced in both 2023 and 2024[33][34].",

  "content": "TRUE. Fossil evidence confirms that at least some non-avian dinosaurs had an umbilical scar, which is the anatomical equivalent of a belly button for an egg-laying animal[1][2][3]. While scientists had long hypothesized that dinosaurs would have such scars due to their oviparous (egg-laying) nature, a 2022 study provided the first physical proof[1][4].\n\n## The First Direct Fossil Evidence\n\nAn international team of paleontologists identified the first-known umbilical scar on an exceptionally well-preserved fossil of a *Psittacosaurus*, a two-meter-long, bipedal herbivore that lived approximately 125 to 130 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period[1][2][5]. This discovery represents the oldest preserved umbilicus in any fossil amniote (the group including reptiles, birds, and mammals)[1][6].\n\n### The Specimen and Discovery Technique\nThe fossil, specimen SMF R 4970, was originally unearthed in China's Liaoning Province two decades prior to the study and is renowned for its preservation of soft tissues, including skin, scales, tail bristles, and a cloaca[7][8][9]. The dinosaur fossilized lying on its back, preserving the abdominal region in detail[5][8].\n\nResearchers used a non-destructive imaging technique called Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) to reveal the scar, which was barely perceptible under normal light[1][5]. The LSF imaging highlighted a change in the scale pattern on the abdomen, identifying an elongated midline structure delimited by a row of paired scales[6][10]. This structure was identified as the umbilical scar[11]. The regular size and smooth margins of the surrounding scales ruled out the possibility of the mark being from trauma or infection[3][7].\n\n## Biological Basis and Comparison to Modern Animals\n\nThe \"belly button\" in a dinosaur is anatomically different from that of placental mammals[7].\n*   **Mammals**: A belly button (navel) is the scar left after the umbilical cord, which connects the fetus to the mother's placenta, is detached at birth[12].\n*   **Egg-Laying Animals**: Dinosaurs, reptiles, and birds develop inside amniotic eggs[13]. The embryo is nourished by a yolk sac, to which it is attached via a yolk stalk or through a slit-like opening in its abdominal wall[1][14]. Just before or shortly after hatching, the embryo absorbs the remainder of the yolk sac, and the opening seals, leaving a linear umbilical scar[15][4].\n\nThis scar is present, at least temporarily, in nearly all modern birds and reptiles[16][17]. However, its persistence into adulthood varies:\n*   In most birds, the scar is minuscule and fades within days or weeks of hatching[14][18].\n*   In many modern reptiles, the scar can persist throughout life, often marked by a distinctive change in scale pattern, similar to what was observed in the *Psittacosaurus* fossil[17].\n\nThe scar on the *Psittacosaurus* specimen bears the closest morphological resemblance to those found on some living lizards and crocodylians[1][15]. Analysis of the fossilized dinosaur's femur length suggests it was 6 to 7 years old and nearing sexual maturity, indicating that its umbilical scar was a permanent feature, unlike in most birds[5][6].\n\n## Conclusion and Scientific Nuance\n\nThe discovery of a distinct umbilical scar on a *Psittacosaurus* fossil provides definitive, factual evidence that at least some dinosaurs had belly buttons[7]. This finding confirms a long-standing biological inference based on the anatomy of modern egg-laying animals[4].\n\nHowever, the authors of the study caution that given the variability of this feature in living reptiles, a persistent umbilical scar may not have been present in all non-avian dinosaurs[6][17]. Other exceptionally preserved dinosaur specimens, such as an *Edmontosaurus* \"mummy\" and a juvenile *Liaoningosaurus*, show no evidence of a similar scar[19]. Therefore, while the statement \"Dinosaurs had belly buttons\" is factually true for at least one species, it remains unknown if this was a universal trait across all dinosaur lineages[11].",

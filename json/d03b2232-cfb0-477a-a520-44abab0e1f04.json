  "content": "FALSE.\n\nThe statement that Apple sold 90 million iPhones and 30 million iPads in 2022 is not factual. Analysis of sales and shipment data indicates that the actual unit counts for both products in 2022 were substantially higher than the figures claimed.\n\n## iPhone Sales Analysis\n\nReported worldwide iPhone sales and shipments for the 2022 calendar year were significantly greater than 90 million units. Multiple sources provide estimates that are more than double the asserted figure. Apple officially stopped reporting product unit sales figures after its 2018 fiscal year, so all values for subsequent years are estimates from market analytics firms[1][2][3].\n\n**Reported iPhone Sales and Shipments in 2022:**\n*   **232.2 million units**[4][1][5]\n*   **226.4 million units**[6]\n*   **225.3 million units**[7][8]\n*   **223.0 million units**[9]\n\nFor context, sales of the iPhone in the United States alone were 124.7 million units in 2022, which exceeds the globally claimed figure of 90 million[5].\n\n## iPad Sales Analysis\n\nSimilarly, the claim of 30 million iPads sold in 2022 is a significant underestimate. Data indicates that iPad shipments were approximately double this amount. As with iPhones, Apple no longer provides official unit sales counts, and the following figures are estimates[10][11].\n\n**Reported iPad Sales and Shipments in 2022:**\n*   **Approximately 63 million units**[12]\n*   **61.7 million units**[13]\n*   **60.4 million units**[13]\n\nThe claimed figure of 30 million is closer to the number of tablets sold by Apple's competitor, Samsung, which shipped 30.2 million units in 2022[13]. Apple's iPad revenue for the four fiscal quarters roughly corresponding to calendar year 2022 (ending December 25, 2021, through September 24, 2022) totaled over $29 billion, comprised of quarterly revenues of $7.25B, $7.65B, $7.22B, and $7.17B[14]. Revenue for the final quarter of calendar 2022 (ending December 31, 2022) was $9.40 billion[14].",

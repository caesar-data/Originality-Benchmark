  "content": "FALSE.\n\nThe claim that the world's tallest pogo stick is 20.2 feet tall is not supported by the official record.\n\n## Official Record for Tallest Pogo Stick\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, the tallest usable pogo stick measures 2.91 meters (9 feet 6.5 inches)[1][2]. This record was set by Fred Grzybowski (USA) in Toronto, Canada, on August 7, 2011[1][2].\n\nThe official measurement is taken from the ground to the top of the foot pedals[1]. To successfully achieve the record, the jumper is required to perform at least twenty consecutive bounces on the pogo stick[1].\n\n## Related Pogo Stick Jump Height Records\n\nThe claim may be confusing the physical height of the pogo stick with the height achieved during a jump. Various pogo stick jump records have been established, all of which are distinct from the apparatus's height.\n\n### Standard and Trick Jumps\n*   **Highest Jump:** The record for the highest jump on a pogo stick is 3.53 meters (11.58 feet), achieved by Henry Cabelus on June 21, 2024, during Pogopalooza 2024[3][4][5]. Previous records were 11 feet 0.5 inches (3.36 m) by Biff Hutchison[6] and 11 feet (3.35m)[7].\n*   **Highest Stickflip Jump:** Henry Cabelus also holds the record for the highest stickflip jump at 3.67 meters (12 feet 0.49 inches), set on June 20, 2025[8].\n*   **Highest Forward Flip Jump:** The record for this category is 3.35 meters (11 feet), achieved by Henry Cabelus on June 20, 2025[9]. A prior record was 3.20 meters (10 feet 6 inches)[9][10].\n*   **Highest Backflip Jump:** Henry Cabelus set this record at 3.07 meters (10 feet 1 inch) on November 4, 2023[11].\n*   **Longest Single Jump:** The longest single jump on a pogo stick is 7.15 meters (23.45 feet), achieved by Duncan Murray[12].\n\n### Historical Progression of Highest Jump Record\nThe world record for the highest jump has progressively increased over the years[13]:\n*   **2006:** 1.82 m (6 ft) by Brian Spencer, later broken by Nick McClintock at 2.13 m (7 ft)[13].\n*   **2007:** 2.28 m (7 ft 6 in) by Fred Grzybowski[13].\n*   **2008:** 2.42 m (8 ft) by David Barab[13].\n*   **2009:** 2.59 m (8 ft 6 in) by Dan Mahoney[13].\n*   **2010:** 2.89 m (9 ft 6.5 in) by Dan Mahoney[13].\n*   **2013:** 2.93 m (9 ft 7 in) by Biff Hutchison[13].\n*   **2014:** 2.97 m (9 ft 9 in) by Biff Hutchison[13].",

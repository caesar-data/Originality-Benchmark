  "content": "**TRUE**: The statement that at least 1 in 4 adults has a low vitamin D level is factual. Global and national data consistently show that prevalence rates for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency meet or significantly exceed the 25% threshold when using standard clinical and public health definitions for \"low\" levels. A large-scale global analysis found that 47.9% of the population has serum vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), a common cutoff for deficiency[1][2][3].\n\n## Defining \"Low\" Vitamin D\n\nThe term \"low vitamin D\" is not standardized and its clinical definition varies among health organizations, often encompassing both \"deficiency\" and \"insufficiency\"[4]. The scientific consensus on precise thresholds continues to evolve, but prevalence data is typically reported using established cutoffs measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.\n\n*   **Deficiency:** The 2011 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, widely cited in research, defines vitamin D deficiency as a 25(OH)D level below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)[5][6]. Many authorities and studies use this threshold[7][8].\n*   **Insufficiency:** The 2011 Endocrine Society guideline defines insufficiency as a 25(OH)D level between 21 and 29 ng/mL[5][9]. A combined \"low\" status (deficiency plus insufficiency) is therefore often considered any level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)[10][11].\n*   **Risk of Deficiency/Inadequacy (CDC/IOM):** The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), referencing the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now the National Academy of Medicine), defines risk of deficiency as levels below 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) and risk of inadequacy as levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL (30\u201349 nmol/L)[12]. Under this framework, levels sufficient for bone health are considered to be at or above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)[12].\n*   **Evolving Guidelines:** In 2024, the Endocrine Society updated its guideline, noting that clinical trial evidence was insufficient to establish specific 25(OH)D thresholds for disease prevention in the general population[13][14]. It no longer endorses its previously proposed definitions for \"sufficiency\" or \"insufficiency\" as actionable designations for otherwise healthy individuals[13]. However, the vast body of existing epidemiological research relies on the earlier, widely adopted thresholds.\n\n## Global Prevalence\n\nVitamin D deficiency is recognized as a global public health issue affecting approximately 1 billion people worldwide[15][16]. A comprehensive pooled analysis of 7.9 million participants from 60 countries between 2000 and 2022 provides the most robust global estimates based on different thresholds[1][2][3]:\n\n*   **Levels < 30 nmol/L (~12 ng/mL):** The global prevalence is **15.7%**. This is below the 25% threshold but represents severe deficiency.\n*   **Levels < 50 nmol/L (~20 ng/mL):** The global prevalence is **47.9%**. This is nearly double the \"1 in 4\" (25%) threshold and aligns with a common definition of deficiency.\n*   **Levels < 75 nmol/L (~30 ng/mL):** The global prevalence is **76.6%**. This figure, representing combined deficiency and insufficiency, means more than 3 in 4 adults fall below this level.\n\nPrevalence varies significantly by region, with some of the highest rates in the Middle East and South Asia[17][18]. In Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, more than 80% of adults experience deficiency[15]. In Europe, approximately 40% of the population has levels below 50 nmol/L[7][19].\n\n## Prevalence in the United States\n\nData from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) consistently supports the claim that at least 1 in 4 adults has a low vitamin D level.\n\n*   **NHANES 2005\u20132006:** The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (defined as \u226420 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L) among U.S. adults was **41.6%**[20].\n*   **NHANES 2011\u20132012:** An analysis found that **39.92%** of participants were vitamin D deficient, using a threshold of <50 nmol/L (~20 ng/mL)[21].\n*   **NHANES 2001\u20132010:** A study of over 26,000 adults found the prevalence of deficiency (<50 nmol/L) was **28.9%**, while an additional **41.4%** had insufficiency (50 to <75 nmol/L)[22]. This means over 70% of U.S. adults had levels below 75 nmol/L (~30 ng/mL).\n*   **NHANES 2001\u20132018:** The most recent comprehensive analysis of 71,685 participants found that a combined **24.6%** of the U.S. population had vitamin D deficiency (2.6% severe at <25 nmol/L and 22.0% moderate at 25\u201350 nmol/L)[23][24]. An additional **40.9%** had insufficiency (50\u201375 nmol/L)[23][24].\n\nThese figures demonstrate that depending on the study period and precise definition, the prevalence of deficiency (<20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L) in the U.S. hovers right at or well above the 25% mark. If \"low\" includes insufficiency (<30 ng/mL), the prevalence is substantially higher.",

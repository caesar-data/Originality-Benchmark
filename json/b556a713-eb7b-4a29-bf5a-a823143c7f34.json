  "content": "FALSE. The statement that the 2023 Winter Universiade was held in Sochi, Russia is incorrect. The event was hosted by Lake Placid, New York, in the United States[1][2].\n\n## Official Host City: Lake Placid, USA\n\nThe International University Sports Federation (FISU) officially designated Lake Placid, New York, as the host city for the 2023 Winter Universiade, also known as the Winter World University Games[3][4]. The host city contract was signed on August 16, 2018, in Lausanne, Switzerland, following an executive order from New York's governor authorizing the region to host the games[5][2].\n\nLake Placid was the only candidate for the event, and its bid was described by FISU officials as \"one of the strongest we have seen\"[2][6]. The games, officially the 31st Winter FISU World University Games, took place from January 12 to January 22, 2023[1][7]. The competition featured 1,443 athletes (832 men and 611 women) from 46 nations competing in 85 medal events[1][8].\n\nThis was the second time Lake Placid hosted the Winter Universiade, with the first occasion being in 1972[3][9]. While Lake Placid was the main host city, events were also held at venues throughout the surrounding North Country region[10][11].\n\n## Russia's Role in the 2023 University Games\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Sochi, Russia, was ever a candidate to host the 2023 **Winter** Universiade. The confusion may stem from a separate event, the **2023 Summer World University Games**.\n\nThe Russian city of Yekaterinburg was the confirmed host for the 2023 Summer edition of the games[12][13]. However, in April 2022, FISU suspended Yekaterinburg's hosting rights in response to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine[14][15][16]. Consequently, Russia did not host the World University Games in 2023[15][17].",

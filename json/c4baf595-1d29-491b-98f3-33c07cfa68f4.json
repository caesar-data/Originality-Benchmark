  "content": "**FALSE**\n\nThe statement \"The world's oldest DNA was found in thousand-year-old saber-toothed tiger fangs\" is factually incorrect on multiple grounds. The current record for the oldest DNA sequenced is approximately two million years old and was recovered from environmental sediment in Greenland, not from a saber-toothed cat.\n\n## The Current Record for Oldest Sequenced DNA\n\nThe world record for the oldest DNA ever sequenced belongs to genetic material recovered from Ice Age sediment in the Kap K\u00f8benhavn Formation in northern Greenland[1][2].\n\n*   **Age:** The DNA is dated to approximately **two million years old**, doubling the previous record[3][4]. Some dating methods suggest a potential age of up to 2.5 million years[5].\n*   **Source:** The genetic material is environmental DNA (eDNA), which consists of microscopic fragments extracted from 41 samples of ancient sediment, specifically clay and quartz, preserved in permafrost[2][6]. It was not taken from a fossilized animal.\n*   **Findings:** The eDNA analysis revealed a lost ecosystem from a period when Greenland was 10-19\u00b0C warmer than it is today[7][8]. Scientists identified the genetic fingerprints of more than 100 different species, including mastodons, reindeer, hares, lemmings, geese, horseshoe crabs, and a variety of plants like poplar, birch, and willow trees[5][9][10].\n\n### Previous DNA Records\n\nPrior to the Greenland discovery, the record for the oldest sequenced DNA from a physical specimen was held by mammoth molars.\n\n*   **Mammoth DNA (Published 2021):** DNA was sequenced from the molar teeth of mammoths preserved in Siberian permafrost[11][12]. The oldest of these samples was dated to be between 1.2 and 1.65 million years old[12][13]. This discovery was the first time DNA older than one million years had been retrieved[11].\n*   **Horse DNA (Published 2013):** Before the mammoth, the record was held by DNA from a horse leg bone found in Canada's Yukon Territory, dated to between 560,000 and 780,000 years old[11][14].\n\n## Analysis of Saber-Toothed Cat (*Smilodon*) DNA\n\nWhile DNA has been successfully extracted from the remains of saber-toothed cats (*Smilodon*), it is significantly younger and does not approach the world record.\n\n*   **Oldest Confirmed *Smilodon* Genome:** A draft nuclear genome of a *Smilodon populator* was sequenced from remains found in a cave in Patagonia, dated to **13,182 \u00b1 90 years old**[15]. At the time, this was the oldest palaeogenome recovered from South America[15].\n*   **La Brea Tar Pits Samples:** An earlier study from 1992 reported the extraction of DNA from a **14,000-year-old** *Smilodon fatalis* bone preserved in asphalt at the La Brea Tar Pits[16][17]. However, subsequent analysis has suggested that this result was likely due to contamination from modern DNA, as the methods used were not able to be replicated and the asphalt is generally considered inhibitory to DNA preservation[18][19].\n\n## Summary of Inaccuracies\n\nThe query is incorrect in every key aspect:\n1.  **Age:** The world's oldest DNA is **2 million years old**, which is on the geological timescale of an epoch (Pleistocene), not the \"thousand-year-old\" scale, which implies a much more recent timeframe[3][20].\n2.  **Organism:** The record-holding DNA did not come from a saber-toothed cat. The current record is from environmental sediment containing genetic material from an entire ecosystem, and the previous record from a single organism was from a mammoth[3][12].\n3.  **Source Material:** The record-holding DNA was extracted from sediment, and the previous record came from mammoth molars (teeth), not saber-toothed cat fangs[2][11].",

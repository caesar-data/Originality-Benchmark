  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe statement that ChatGPT possesses real-time web browsing capability is factually correct[1][2]. OpenAI has integrated features that allow the ChatGPT application to access, process, and cite information from the live internet, thereby overcoming the knowledge cutoff of its static training data[3][4]. This capability, which has evolved through different implementations, is now available to all users, including those on the free tier[2][5]. However, this functionality is distinct to the ChatGPT application and is not an inherent feature of the OpenAI API, which requires developers to build their own web browsing infrastructure[6][7].\n\n## Evolution of Web Access in ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT's ability to access the internet has progressed through several distinct phases and features, moving from an experimental plugin to a core, integrated function.\n\n### Initial Implementation: Plugins and \"Browse with Bing\"\nOpenAI first introduced web browsing to ChatGPT via a plugin system in May 2023, which was available in beta to ChatGPT Plus subscribers[8][3]. OpenAI created a specific \"Browsing\" plugin that allowed the model to retrieve information from the web[9][10]. This functionality was later integrated more deeply and branded as \"Browse with Bing\"[8].\n\nThe feature was temporarily disabled on July 3, 2023, after it was discovered that it could inadvertently bypass website paywalls and display the full text of a URL if specifically requested[8][11][12]. After implementing fixes, OpenAI re-enabled browsing for Plus users on September 27, 2023, and the feature moved out of beta for Plus and Enterprise users on October 17, 2023[8].\n\nThe browsing mechanism uses the Bing search API to retrieve content[10]. To respect website policies, the browser identifies itself with the user-agent token `ChatGPT-User` and is configured to honor `robots.txt` files[10].\n\n### Current Implementation: Integrated ChatGPT Search\nThe current primary web access feature is \"ChatGPT search\"[1]. This capability allows ChatGPT to determine if a query would benefit from current information and automatically search the web to provide timely answers with direct links to sources[2][13]. This functionality leverages a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o and utilizes third-party search providers[2]. As of February 5, 2025, ChatGPT search is available to all users, including free and logged-out users, in supported regions[2][13].\n\n### Advanced Capability: ChatGPT Agent and Operator\nFor more complex tasks, OpenAI has introduced \"ChatGPT agent\" (formerly a research preview called \"Operator\"), an AI agent that can perform actions on the web[14][15]. This agent uses both a text-based browser for simple queries and a visual browser that can \"see\" screenshots of a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling[16][15]. This allows it to handle tasks like filling out forms, booking travel, and creating presentations from online data[15]. This capability is integrated into ChatGPT as \"agent mode\"[14].\n\n## Key Limitations and Nuances\n\nWhile ChatGPT has real-time browsing, the capability is subject to significant limitations.\n\n### Application vs. API\nThe web browsing functionality is native to the ChatGPT application (web and mobile) but is not included in the OpenAI API[17]. Developers using the API must implement their own web search functionality by defining \"functions\" that the model can call to query an external search service[6].\n\n### Performance and Reliability\nThe browsing feature has faced criticism for performance issues, including being slow, inconsistent, and sometimes failing to execute searches[18][19]. At times, the model may unpredictably default to its internal knowledge base instead of performing a live web search for the same prompt[20]. Some analyses have found the feature disappointing compared to third-party plugins like WebPilot[21]. The system may also rely on a single web source for an answer, which can be a significant limitation[20].\n\n### Accuracy and Transparency\nDespite having web access, the model can still produce inaccurate information or \"hallucinate\"[22]. Tests have shown the browsing feature providing factually incorrect real-time data, such as stock market valuations, due to retrieving outdated search results[23]. Furthermore, the \"Browse with Bing\" feature was criticized for a lack of transparency, as it did not always \"show its work\" by detailing the steps it took or the pages it visited to formulate a response[24][25]. The current ChatGPT Search feature addresses this by providing inline citations and a \"Sources\" button[2][13].\n\n### Access Restrictions\nChatGPT's browsing tool cannot access all websites. It is designed to honor `robots.txt` files, which allows site administrators to block crawlers[10]. Some major websites, such as Amazon, block OpenAI's bot, preventing the feature from accessing their content[20]. Additionally, workspace owners on team plans can request to block specific websites from being accessed by the ChatGPT agent[16].\n\n## Availability Across Subscription Tiers\n\nWeb browsing capabilities are available across all primary ChatGPT subscription tiers, though access to more advanced tools and higher usage limits is reserved for paid plans.\n\n| Subscription Tier | Cost | Web Access Capability |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Free** | $0 | Includes ChatGPT Search for web-augmented responses[5][26]. As of Feb 2025, search is available to all free users[2]. |\n| **Plus** | $20/month | Includes ChatGPT Search and access to advanced tools like Deep Research, which performs web-assisted research with citations[27][28]. |\n| **Pro** | $200/month | Includes all features of Plus with higher/unlimited usage, plus access to the Operator/agent research preview for performing interactive tasks on the web[29][30]. |\n| **Team / Enterprise** | Custom | Includes all features of lower tiers, with administrative controls that can include blocking agent access to certain websites[16][30]. |",

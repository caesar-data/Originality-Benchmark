  "content": "FALSE: Croatia did not adopt the Yen. On January 1, 2023, Croatia adopted the Euro (\u20ac) as its official currency, replacing the Croatian Kuna (HRK)[1][2][3].\n\n## Croatia's Currency Transition\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Republic of Croatia officially joined the eurozone, becoming its 20th member state[3][4][5][6]. This move, which came nearly a decade after Croatia joined the European Union, involved replacing its national currency with the Euro (\u20ac)[4][7]. The accession was formally approved by the Council of the European Union on July 12, 2022[3][4][8].\n\n### The New Official Currency: The Euro\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Euro (EUR) is the official currency and legal tender in Croatia[9][10][11]. The country successfully met all required economic criteria to facilitate this change[4][8]. The adoption of the Euro marked the first expansion of the eurozone since Lithuania joined in 2015[12][13]. Following Croatia's entry, Bulgaria is expected to be the next country to adopt the Euro[14][15].\n\n### The Replaced Currency: The Croatian Kuna\n\nPrior to adopting the Euro, Croatia's official currency was the Kuna (sign: kn; code: HRK)[16][10]. The Kuna served as Croatia's currency from May 30, 1994, until January 1, 2023[16][17]. The word \"kuna\" translates to \"marten,\" an animal whose pelts were historically used as a unit of trade[10][7]. The Kuna was subdivided into 100 lipa[16][18].\n\n### Transition and Conversion Details\n\nThe transition from the Kuna to the Euro was managed with a fixed conversion rate set by the Council of the European Union[3][19].\n\n*   **Fixed Conversion Rate**: The official, permanent exchange rate was set at \u20ac1 = 7.53450 HRK[3][12][9].\n*   **Dual Circulation Period**: For the first two weeks of January 2023, both the Kuna and the Euro were accepted as legal tender to facilitate a smooth transition, with change being provided in Euros[3][20]. After this period, the Euro became the sole official currency[21].\n*   **Dual Price Display**: To protect consumers and ensure transparency, businesses were required to display prices in both Kuna and Euros until December 31, 2023[20].\n*   **Exchange of Old Currency**: Croatian citizens could exchange Kuna banknotes and coins for Euros free of charge throughout 2023[9]. The Croatian National Bank will continue to exchange Kuna banknotes indefinitely and coins until December 31, 2025[22].",

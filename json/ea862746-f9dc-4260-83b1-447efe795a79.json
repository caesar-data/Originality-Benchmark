  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe claim that California experienced 7,477 wildfires in 2022 is factual, based on official data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)[1][2][3]. While other figures exist, the number 7,477 is the most consistently reported total in CAL FIRE's direct incident archives.\n\n## Detailed Wildfire Statistics for 2022\n\n### Official Fire Count and Discrepancies\n\nMultiple official sources and media outlets confirm the 7,477 figure, directly attributing it to CAL FIRE data.\n\n*   **CAL FIRE Data:** The official CAL FIRE \"2022 Incident Archive\" page explicitly states there were 7,477 wildfires, which burned a total of 331,358 acres[1][2][3].\n*   **Supporting Sources:** Several other sources corroborate this number, including the *Los Angeles Times* and wildfire tracking site Frontline[4][5]. Wikipedia's page for the 2022 California wildfires also lists the total as 7,477[6].\n\nA slightly different figure of 7,490 wildfires is also reported by some sources, which also cite CAL FIRE[7][8][9]. This minor discrepancy is often accompanied by a different acreage total of 362,455 acres burned[8][9]. Such variations can occur due to differences in how data is aggregated across various jurisdictions (state, federal, local) over time. Definitive clarification is typically found in CAL FIRE's annual \"Redbook\" statistical reports, which detail fires by jurisdiction[10].\n\n### An Explained Outlier: The CARB Figure\n\nA significantly lower number of 305 wildfires was reported by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for 2022[11]. This figure is not a comprehensive count of all fire incidents but is specific to CARB's methodology for estimating greenhouse gas and particulate matter emissions[12]. CARB's process uses data from CAL FIRE's wildfire geodatabase and the U.S. Forest Service's First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) to calculate emissions from fires that are reported and mapped for this purpose[12]. The agency historically tracks wildfire emissions separately from its inventory of manmade, fossil fuel-generated emissions[13][14].\n\n## Context of the 2022 Wildfire Season\n\nThe 2022 wildfire season was considered unusually tame compared to previous years[4]. The total number of fires (7,490 according to one source) was about 3% below the five-year average of 7,746[7]. The total area burned was significantly lower than the five-year average of over 2.3 million acres[1].\n\n### Impacts and Key Incidents\n\n*   **Acreage:** The 7,477 fires burned 331,358 acres[1].\n*   **Fatalities:** The fires resulted in 9 civilian fatalities and no firefighter deaths[1][7].\n*   **Structures:** A total of 1,279 structures were impacted, with 946 destroyed and 333 damaged[1]. Another source places the number of destroyed structures at 772 and damaged at 104[7].\n*   **Largest Fire:** The largest incident of the year was the Mosquito Fire, which burned 76,788 acres in El Dorado and Placer counties[1][7].\n*   **Most Destructive Fires:** The McKinney Fire destroyed 185 structures in July, and the Oak Fire destroyed 182 structures, also in July[7].\n\n### Historical Comparison\n\nThe 2022 season's burned acreage stands in stark contrast to more severe recent years. For comparison, 2.5 million acres burned in 2021 and a record-breaking 4.3 million acres burned in 2020[7][5]. The number of fires in 2022 was also lower than in 2021 (7,396 incidents) and 2020 (8,648 incidents)[5].",

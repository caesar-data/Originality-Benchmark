  "content": "**TRUE**: Based on publicly available streaming data from Spotify, Laufey's 2023 single \"From the Start\" is the most-streamed jazz song on the platform, surpassing numerous iconic standards from the genre's history[1].\n\n## Analysis of \"From the Start\" Streaming Performance\n\nLaufey's \"From the Start,\" the lead single from her Grammy-winning album *Bewitched*, has achieved significant commercial success, driven by viral trends and broad appeal[2][3]. As of October 2025, the track has accumulated over 849 million streams on Spotify alone[4]. Other data aggregators report similar figures, with ChartMasters listing 848.2 million streams and Musicmetricsvault showing 846.7 million streams[5][6].\n\nThe claim that it was the \"most streamed jazz song in the world\" began circulating in 2023, attributed to statements from Laufey's record label, AWAL[7][8]. Current data confirms that, at least on Spotify, the song holds this title based on cumulative streams[1].\n\n### Genre Classification\n\nThe classification of \"From the Start\" as a jazz song is a critical component of the claim's validity. While Laufey's music incorporates elements of multiple genres, industry authorities categorize her work within the jazz landscape[9].\n*   **Billboard**: The chart authority explicitly categorizes Laufey as a \"jazz\" artist[10][11]. Her album *Bewitched* broke the record for the biggest debut for a jazz album in Spotify history and topped Billboard's Traditional Jazz Albums chart[7][12].\n*   **Musical Style**: Critics and databases describe the song's genre as a blend of bossa nova, jazz pop, and traditional pop[13][12][14]. Laufey herself refers to her style as \"modern jazz\"[15].\n\n## Comparative Streaming Data on Spotify\n\nTo verify its standing as the \"most-streamed,\" \"From the Start\" must be compared against other highly-streamed songs widely considered to be jazz or jazz-adjacent. The following table contrasts its performance with that of canonical jazz standards on Spotify.\n\n| Song Title | Artist(s) | Spotify Streams (approx.) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **\"From the Start\"** | **Laufey** | **849.7 million**[4] |\n| \"Just the Two of Us\" | Grover Washington, Jr. ft. Bill Withers | 814.0 million[16] |\n| \"Fly Me To The Moon\" | Frank Sinatra & Count Basie | 787.9 million[17][18] |\n| \"What a Wonderful World\" | Louis Armstrong | 740.1 million[19] |\n| \"Don't Know Why\" | Norah Jones | 648.3 million[20][21] |\n| \"Feeling Good\" | Michael Bubl\u00e9 | 641.0 million[22] |\n| \"Feeling Good\" | Nina Simone | 565.4 million[23] |\n| \"Take Five\" | The Dave Brubeck Quartet | 293.8 million[24] |\n\n*Stream counts are as of October 2025 and based on the most-streamed version of each track available on the platform.*\n\nThis data demonstrates that \"From the Start\" has surpassed the Spotify stream counts of some of the most enduring and commercially successful jazz recordings of all time, including tracks by Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and Nina Simone, as well as modern crossover hits from artists like Norah Jones and Michael Bubl\u00e9. The closest competitor is the smooth jazz classic \"Just the Two of Us\" by Grover Washington, Jr. and Bill Withers, which \"From the Start\" leads by over 35 million streams[4][16].",

  "content": "TRUE. The United Nations officially declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets[1][2][3].\n\n## Official Declaration and Timeline\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted resolution A/RES/75/263 during its 75th session in March 2021, officially designating 2023 as the International Year of Millets (IYM 2023)[4][5][6][7][8]. The resolution explicitly \"Decides to declare 2023 the International Year of Millets\"[4].\n\nThe path to this declaration began earlier. In 2018, the council of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations approved a proposal from India to observe an international year for millets[9][10][11]. This endorsement by the FAO's 160th session paved the way for the formal resolution at the UN General Assembly[12][10].\n\n## Leadership and Rationale\n\nThe initiative was spearheaded by the Government of India, which sponsored the proposal at the United Nations[13][14][15]. The draft resolution was co-sponsored by more than 70 countries, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Russia, and Senegal, and was adopted by consensus[16][8][17]. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed a vision to position the country as a \"Global Hub for Millets\" and make the IYM 2023 a \"People's Movement\"[13][18].\n\nThe UN and FAO designated the year to address significant global challenges[19]. The FAO stated that as global agrifood systems face difficulties in feeding a growing world population, resilient cereals like millets offer an affordable and nutritious option[20][19]. Millets have been historically neglected, receiving less policy and research attention compared to staple crops like corn, wheat, and rice, despite their potential to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[2].\n\n## Key Objectives and Implementation\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was named the lead agency for coordinating the year's activities in collaboration with other stakeholders[1][7][21].\n\nThe primary objectives of IYM 2023 were to:\n*   **Raise Awareness**: Increase public and policy attention on the nutritional and health benefits of millets[1][22][23][16]. Millets are nutritionally superior to wheat and rice in many aspects, being high in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals[24][25][26].\n*   **Promote Climate Resilience**: Highlight the suitability of millets for cultivation under adverse and changing climatic conditions, as they are drought-resistant and can grow in poor soil with minimal water and inputs[1][2][16][25].\n*   **Enhance Market Opportunities**: Create sustainable market opportunities for producers and consumers and encourage investment in research, development, and extension services related to millets[8][20][27].\n*   **Contribute to SDGs**: Support collective efforts to empower smallholder farmers, achieve food security, eliminate hunger, adapt to climate change, and transform agrifood systems in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development[20][28][29].\n\n## Global Campaign and Activities\n\nThe IYM 2023 was officially launched with an opening ceremony at the FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, on December 6, 2022[13][30][20]. A closing ceremony was also held in Rome on March 29, 2024, to mark the end of the year-long celebration[8][31]. The campaign involved numerous activities worldwide, including seminars, millet-themed fairs (\"melas\"), and a global chefs' challenge to promote millet-based recipes[32][33][34]. The campaign successfully reached over 138 million users through social media and included more than 100 events in 35 countries[35].",

What has happened through it? Let's take a look.\n\nWhat is the International Year of Millets?\n\nThe International Year of Millets (IYM 2023) was a global initiative that took place throughout 2023 to raise awareness of the many benefits of millets and promote Millet Sustainability. It was officially declared by the United Nations.\n\nWhy should 2023 be declared as the year of millets?\n\nRice, wheat, and maize are the dominant food crops in the world today. Due to the lack of awareness about millets, the global production of millets has decreased by 89%.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jacqueline Hughes, Director General of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Indians consumed one-third of their diet with millets in the last century. However, the per capita consumption of millet has decreased significantly by 83% in rural areas and 77% in urban areas.\n\nMakiko Taguchi, an officer of the Food and Agriculture Organization, has said that people who have produced millet and used it in their lives have lost their tradition.\n\nTime for Back to Tradition \ud83e\udd73\n\nThat's why it's time to go back to tradition! Millets, an ancient superfood, offer significant health benefits compared to wheat, rice, and maize. They're packed with protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, supporting heart health, digestion, blood sugar control, and weight management. Moreover, they have a low glycemic index and are naturally gluten-free.\n\nNativeSpecial Delivers a variety of delicious and convenient millet options for everyone! Kids will love their Special Millets Health Mix and Millet Biscuits, while adults can enjoy the traditionally made Pazhani Special Thinai Maavu and more. Avoid junk foods and embrace the power of healthy, ancient grains.\n\nBuy now @ https://t.co/Un2BskBSXK\n\n#Nativespecial #IYM2023 #Millets #foods #orderonline #doordelivery",

      "title": "Why are we crazy about millets? Glad you asked! \n\nThere is a reason why the Food and Agriculture Organization and United Nations has recognised 2023 as the International Year of Millets. Millets can grow in poor quality soil and will improve the health of that soil. Their deep, fibrous root systems break up and aerate compacted soil, improving soil structure and increasing organic content.\n\nMillets are also incredibly water efficient, eliminating the need for costly and environmentally damaging dams and irrigation systems. With the effects of climate change now upon us, and the increasing unpredictability of rainfall, millets are becoming a crucial grain for the global community.\n\nAction now: https://t.co/uVnQCIZBeZ\n\n#SaveSoil #ConsciousPlanet #SoilForClimateAction #SaveSoilFixClimateChange",

  "content": "FALSE. The statement that *Oppenheimer* is the highest-grossing film in Christopher Nolan's career is not factual. While a significant commercial success, *Oppenheimer* ranks as his third highest-grossing film globally[1][2][3]. Two other films in his filmography have surpassed the billion-dollar mark, placing them ahead of *Oppenheimer*'s box office performance[4][3].\n\n## Comparative Box Office Analysis\n\nChristopher Nolan's highest-grossing film is *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), followed by *The Dark Knight* (2008)[1][5][6]. *Oppenheimer* (2023) is his third most commercially successful film and his highest-grossing non-Batman movie[3].\n\n### Worldwide Box Office Gross of Top Nolan Films\n\nThe box office performance clearly delineates the top three films in Nolan's career, with both installments of his *Dark Knight* trilogy that followed *Batman Begins* exceeding the one-billion-dollar threshold.\n\n| Rank | Film Title | Worldwide Gross (USD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) | $1,081,169,825[1] |\n| 2 | *The Dark Knight* (2008) | $1,006,234,167[1] |\n| 3 | *Oppenheimer* (2023) | $975,811,333[7][8] |\n| 4 | *Inception* (2010) | $870,792,649[1] |\n| 5 | *Interstellar* (2014) | $773,430,538[1] |\n\n### Detailed Financial Performance\n\n*   ***The Dark Knight Rises***: As the conclusion to his Batman trilogy, the film grossed over $1.08 billion globally, making it Nolan's highest-grossing movie[5][9]. Sources cite figures ranging from $1.081 billion to $1.114 billion[1][10].\n*   ***The Dark Knight***: The second installment of the trilogy was also a massive commercial success, earning over $1 billion worldwide[11][12]. Its performance, driven in part by Heath Ledger's posthumous Oscar-winning role as the Joker, set numerous box office records at the time of its release[3][13].\n*   ***Oppenheimer***: The biographical thriller grossed approximately $975.8 million worldwide[14][6]. Its domestic gross was $330.1 million, with international markets contributing $645.7 million[8]. Despite not being his highest earner, its success is considered a remarkable achievement for a three-hour, R-rated historical drama[15][16]. It became the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the highest-grossing Best Picture Oscar winner in 20 years[8][17][18].",

  "content": "**TRUE**: The statement that at least 1 in 5 adults has a low iron level is factual, supported by global estimates and national data from major regions including the United States and Europe.\n\nA \"low iron level\" corresponds clinically to iron deficiency (ID), a condition where the body's iron stores are insufficient to meet its needs[1][2]. This state can exist with or without anemia[3]. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the more severe stage that occurs when iron levels are low enough to impair the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells[4][5]. The assertion addresses the broader condition of iron deficiency.\n\n## Global Prevalence of Iron Deficiency\n\nMultiple global health estimates indicate that the prevalence of iron deficiency meets or exceeds the 20% threshold (\"1 in 5\").\n*   One estimate, citing the World Health Organization (WHO), states that 1.6 billion people, or one-fifth (20%) of the world's population, are iron deficient[6].\n*   Other sources report that over 2 billion people worldwide are affected by iron deficiency[3][7], a figure that would place the prevalence closer to 25% of the global population[8].\n*   The Global Burden of Disease Study for 2021 found the global prevalence of *dietary* iron deficiency was 16.7%[9]. This figure does not include other causes of iron deficiency, such as chronic blood loss or absorption issues, suggesting the all-cause prevalence is higher[10].\n*   Iron deficiency is considered the most common nutritional deficiency in the world[11][12].\n\n## Prevalence in the United States\n\nRecent, nationally representative data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2017-2020 confirms a high prevalence of iron deficiency among adults, well above the 20% threshold.\n\nThe analysis categorizes iron deficiency into two distinct, mutually exclusive types:\n*   **Absolute Iron Deficiency**: Defined by depleted iron stores (serum ferritin <30 ng/mL)[13]. This affects an estimated **14%** of U.S. adults[14][13].\n*   **Functional Iron Deficiency**: Characterized by sufficient iron stores that are not available for use (serum ferritin \u226530 ng/mL with transferrin saturation <20%)[13]. This affects an estimated **15%** of U.S. adults[14][13].\n\nBecause the definitions are based on mutually exclusive ferritin levels, the total prevalence of adults with some form of iron deficiency is the sum of these two groups, totaling **29%**[14][13]. This figure, equivalent to more than 1 in 4 adults, substantially exceeds the \"1 in 5\" benchmark.\n\nPrevalence is particularly high in certain demographics. For women aged 18 to <50 years, the prevalence of absolute iron deficiency alone is 34%[14].\n\n## Prevalence in Europe\n\nData from Europe also supports the claim, with studies showing prevalence rates often exceeding 20%, particularly in specific populations.\n*   A review of studies in Europe found the prevalence of iron deficiency in adults (aged 16\u201350 years) ranges from 4% to 33%[15][16].\n*   A recent large-scale observational trial (DO-HEALTH) involving relatively healthy European older adults (mean age 74.9) found an overall iron deficiency prevalence of **26.8%**[17]. The rate varied by country, with the highest prevalence found in Portugal at 34.5%[17].\n*   Among women of reproductive age in Europe, the prevalence of iron deficiency is estimated to be between 10% and 32%[18]. An older Icelandic study found that 1 in 4 (25%) urban premenopausal women had evidence of iron deficiency[19].\n\n## High Prevalence in Women of Reproductive Age\n\nWhile the query concerns the general adult population, data from the high-risk demographic of non-pregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) further underscores the widespread nature of iron deficiency.\n*   **Global**: The WHO estimates that 30% of women aged 15-49 years worldwide are anemic, with iron deficiency being the primary cause[20].\n*   **Canada**: A large study in Ontario found that of the WRA screened, 38.3% had non-anemic iron deficiency and an additional 13.1% had iron deficiency anemia[21][22].\n*   **India**: One study of non-pregnant WRA in Punjab reported an iron deficiency prevalence of 67%[23].\n*   **United States**: A study of Hispanic/Latino WRA found an overall iron deficiency prevalence of 34.4%[24][25]. NHANES data for U.S. females aged 12-21 years showed an iron deficiency prevalence of nearly 40%[26][27].",

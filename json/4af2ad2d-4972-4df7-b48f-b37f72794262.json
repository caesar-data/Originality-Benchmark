The human nose can detect the potent odor of hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) in concentrations as low as, and even significantly lower than, 1 part per billion (ppb).\n\n## Analysis of Hydrogen Sulfide Odor Detection Threshold\n\nHydrogen sulfide is a colorless, flammable gas recognized by its characteristic \"rotten egg\" smell[1][2][3][4]. The concentration at which it can be detected by smell, known as the odor threshold, is extremely low, though reported values vary across scientific literature and among different individuals[2][5].\n\n### Official Thresholds and Reported Ranges\n\nGovernmental health and safety agencies have established and reported various odor thresholds for H\u2082S, with many values falling at or below 1 ppb.\n\n*   **Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR):** The ATSDR states that the rotten-egg odor of H\u2082S is detectable at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb[6]. The agency reports a general odor threshold range of 0.0005 to 0.3 parts per million (ppm), which is equivalent to 0.5 to 300 ppb[7][8][9][10].\n*   **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA):** OSHA documents an odor threshold range of 0.01 to 1.5 ppm (10 to 1,500 ppb)[11][12][13].\n*   **California Air Resources Board (CARB):** The average odor detection threshold is cited as being around 0.03 to 0.05 ppm (30 to 50 ppb), although it is noted that some individuals can detect H\u2082S at lower levels[14]. The state's one-hour standard for H\u2082S, set for odor control, is 0.03 ppm[14].\n*   **Scientific Literature:** A comprehensive review of 26 different studies found that average odor detection thresholds ranged from 0.00007 ppm to 1.4 ppm (0.07 ppb to 1,400 ppb)[5][15]. Other reviews have cited detection thresholds for pure H\u2082S as low as 0.000013 ppm (0.013 ppb)[5]. One study recorded an odor threshold of 0.00041 ppm (0.41 ppb)[16].\n\n### Sensitivity and Individual Variation\n\nThe ability to detect hydrogen sulfide varies significantly from person to person[5].\n\n*   Some sources report that people can smell H\u2082S at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb[1][17].\n*   Another source states that most people can smell it at levels as low as 1 to 5 ppb[18].\n*   One study on population response to the odor found that 2% of people recognized H\u2082S at 0.5 ppb, 14% at 2 ppb, 30% at 4 ppb, 50% at 8 ppb, and 83% at 30 ppb[5].\n*   The concentration at which 50% of a population can detect the odor has been recognized as 0.0047 ppm (4.7 ppb)[19].\n\n### Olfactory Fatigue and Health Considerations\n\nWhile the human nose is highly sensitive to H\u2082S at low concentrations, this sense is not a reliable indicator for safety at higher levels[6].\n\n*   **Olfactory Fatigue:** At concentrations around 100 ppm, the sense of smell can quickly become fatigued, causing a loss of odor perception[1][21]. This means a person might incorrectly assume the gas has dissipated when it is actually present at dangerous levels.\n*   **Nerve Paralysis:** At 150 ppm, paralysis of the olfactory nerve can occur[1][21][23].\n*   **Health Effects:** While low-level odor detection below 30 ppb is not expected to cause irritation or respiratory effects for most people, some individuals may be sensitive to the odors[24]. Prolonged exposure at 2-5 ppm may cause nausea, eye tearing, and headaches[11]. Concentrations above 100 ppm can cause severe respiratory irritation, and levels of 500-1,000 ppm can cause rapid unconsciousness and death.",

  "content": "FALSE. The claim that August 2023 was the planet's coldest month on record is factually incorrect. All provided evidence from multiple international climate agencies indicates that August 2023 was, in fact, the warmest August on record globally, and one of the two warmest months ever recorded overall.\n\n## Global Temperature Records for August 2023\n\nData from numerous climate monitoring organizations establishes a clear consensus that August 2023 set a record for warmth, directly contradicting the user's query[1].\n\n### Consensus on Record Warmth\nMultiple independent climate agencies have confirmed August 2023's record-breaking heat:\n*   **NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)** reported that August 2023 was the warmest August in its 174-year record[2].\n*   **The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)** also concluded that August 2023 was the warmest August on record globally[3][4].\n*   **NASA, Berkeley Earth, and the Japan Meteorological Agency** all independently rated August 2023 as the warmest August on record, with some analyses showing it surpassed the previous record by a significant margin[1].\n*   Subsequent data from August 2024 confirmed this record, with Copernicus reporting that August 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally, tied with August 2023[5][6]. Data for August 2025 ranked it as the third warmest, behind both 2023 and 2024[7][8].\n\n### Quantitative Analysis of Temperature Anomalies\nThe record-breaking nature of August 2023 is demonstrated by specific temperature anomalies reported by climate agencies:\n*   **NOAA**: The global surface temperature was 1.25\u00b0C (2.25\u00b0F) above the 20th-century average of 15.6\u00b0C (60.1\u00b0F)[2][1]. This was 0.29\u00b0C (0.52\u00b0F) above the previous record for August set in 2016[2].\n*   **Copernicus (C3S)**: The global-mean surface air temperature was 16.82\u00b0C[3][9]. This was 0.71\u00b0C warmer than the 1991-2020 average for August and 0.31\u00b0C warmer than the previous warmest August in 2016[3][4]. The month was also estimated to be approximately 1.5\u00b0C warmer than the pre-industrial average (1850-1900)[3][4].\n\n## Contextual Ranking and Broader Trends\n\nAugust 2023's record heat was not an isolated event but part of a period of sustained, unprecedented global temperatures.\n\n### Ranking Among All Months\nAugust 2023 was not only the warmest August but also the second-warmest month ever recorded globally across all months, surpassed only by July 2023[3][10][4][11]. The global-mean temperature in July 2023 reached a record 16.95\u00b0C, compared to 16.82\u00b0C in August 2023[4].\n\n### Record-Breaking Seasonal and Annual Context\nThe month was a component of several larger-scale climate records:\n*   **Boreal Summer 2023**: The June-July-August 2023 period was the warmest boreal summer on record globally by a large margin, with an average temperature of 16.77\u00b0C, which is 0.66\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average[3][4].\n*   **Year-to-Date 2023**: The period from January to August 2023 ranked as the second-warmest such period on record, trailing 2016 by only 0.01\u00b0C[2][3].\n*   **Warmest Year**: This period of intense heat contributed to 2023 becoming the warmest year on record by a definitive margin[12][13]. The last seven months of 2023 all set new monthly temperature records[12].\n\n### Oceanic Temperature Records\nThe exceptional atmospheric heat was mirrored in the oceans. In August 2023, the global monthly average sea surface temperature (SST) was the highest on record for any month, at 20.98\u00b0C[3][14]. According to NOAA, the monthly sea surface temperature anomaly in August 2023 (+1.03\u00b0C or +1.85\u00b0F) tied with September 2023 for the highest of any month in its 174-year record[15].",

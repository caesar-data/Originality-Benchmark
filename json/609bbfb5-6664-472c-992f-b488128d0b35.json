  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) ultimately filed a total of 13 criminal charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried through an initial indictment and a series of subsequent, or \"superseding,\" indictments[1][2][3]. He pleaded not guilty to all 13 counts[4][5].\n\n## Evolution of the Charges\n\n### Initial Eight-Count Indictment\nOn December 13, 2022, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the initial eight-count indictment against Bankman-Fried[6][7][8]. The original charges included a combination of fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, and campaign finance violations[9][10].\n\nThe specific charges in the original indictment were[9][11][12]:\n*   Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Customers\n*   Wire Fraud on Customers\n*   Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Lenders\n*   Wire Fraud on Lenders\n*   Conspiracy to Commit Commodities Fraud\n*   Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud\n*   Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering\n*   Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and Violate Campaign Finance Laws\n\n### Superseding Indictments Increasing the Charge Count\nProsecutors subsequently filed superseding indictments that expanded the scope of the charges against Bankman-Fried[1].\n\n*   **Increase to 12 Charges**: In February 2023, a superseding indictment added four new criminal charges, bringing the total to 12[13][14][15]. The added counts included conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business[13][16].\n\n*   **Increase to 13 Charges**: On March 28, 2023, prosecutors filed another superseding indictment, adding a thirteenth charge for conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)[17][2]. This charge stemmed from an alleged plot to pay a $40 million bribe to Chinese officials to unfreeze Alameda Research trading accounts containing approximately $1 billion in cryptocurrency[18][19].\n\n## Legal Proceedings and Trial Structure\nDue to the terms of Bankman-Fried's extradition from the Bahamas, the 13 charges were slated to be handled across two separate trials[3][20]. His first trial, which began in October 2023, proceeded on seven of the original eight counts[20][10]. He was ultimately convicted on all seven of these charges, which included two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy[21][22]. A federal judge later sentenced him to 25 years in prison[23][24]. The remaining charges were scheduled for a second trial in March 2024[3].",

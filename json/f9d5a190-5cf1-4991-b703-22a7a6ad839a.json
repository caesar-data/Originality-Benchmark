  "content": "TRUE. The hand gesture associated with the Vulcan phrase \"Live Long and Prosper\" was created by actor Leonard Nimoy and is directly derived from a Jewish religious ritual known as the Priestly Blessing[1][2][3]. Nimoy adapted a specific hand gesture he observed during services at an Orthodox synagogue in his childhood to create the iconic Vulcan salute[4][5].\n\n## Origin of the Vulcan Salute\n\nLeonard Nimoy consistently recounted that the inspiration for the Vulcan salute came from a vivid childhood memory[6][7]. As a boy of about eight, he attended Orthodox Jewish High Holiday services with his family in Boston[8][9]. During the service, a group of men known as Kohanim\u2014members of the hereditary priestly tribe descended from Aaron\u2014performed a blessing over the congregation[6][10].\n\nNimoy's father instructed him not to look, as it is believed that the Shekhinah, or the feminine aspect of God's presence, enters the sanctuary during this blessing, and its light is too powerful for a mortal to see and survive[11][8]. Despite the warning, Nimoy peeked and saw the Kohanim with their prayer shawls (*tallit*) over their heads, extending both hands toward the congregation with their fingers parted in a distinctive way[6][7]. He was entranced by the \"magical\" gesture and taught himself how to do it[12][11].\n\nYears later, while filming the *Star Trek* episode \"Amok Time\" (which aired September 15, 1967), Nimoy felt that a unique greeting was needed for the first on-screen encounter between Vulcans[13][14]. Arguing that Vulcans, like humans with handshakes or military personnel with salutes, would have their own ritual, he suggested the gesture from his childhood to the episode's director, Joseph Pevney[8][15]. Pevney accepted the idea immediately[11]. The accompanying phrase, \"Live long and prosper,\" was written by the episode's screenwriter, Theodore Sturgeon[14].\n\n## The Jewish Priestly Blessing (*Birkat Kohanim*)\n\nThe ritual Nimoy witnessed is the *Birkat Kohanim* (\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05db\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd), or Priestly Blessing, also known as *Nesi'at Kapayim* (\"lifting of the hands\")[16]. The text of the blessing is from the biblical Book of Numbers (6:24\u201326)[17][18].\n\n### The Hand Gesture\nDuring the blessing, the Kohanim raise their hands and spread their fingers to form the shape of the Hebrew letter Shin (\u05e9)[19]. This letter is significant as it is the first letter of *Shaddai*, one of the names of God, as well as *Shekhinah* and *Shalom* (peace)[20][21]. The gesture symbolizes the divine presence shining through the priests' fingers to bless the congregation[22][23].\n\n### Comparison of Ritual and Salute\nThe primary differences between the traditional blessing and the Vulcan salute are:\n*   **Number of Hands:** The *Birkat Kohanim* is performed with both hands extended[25]. Nimoy adapted it to a one-handed gesture for the Vulcan salute[17].\n*   **Orientation:** During the Jewish ritual, the hands are typically held horizontally at shoulder level with the palms facing downward[26]. The Vulcan salute is performed with the hand raised vertically.\n\nNimoy expressed great pleasure that the gesture resonated so widely, noting that \"people don\u2019t realize they\u2019re blessing each other with this!\"[27][28]. The symbol of the two hands performing the blessing is a common motif found on the tombstones of Kohanim[17][29].",

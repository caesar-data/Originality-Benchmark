  "content": "TRUE. The provided research unanimously confirms that the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand[1][2][3].\n\n## Tournament Hosting Details\n\nThe ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup took place from July 20 to August 20, 2023, across Australia and New Zealand[4][5][6]. The selection of Australia and New Zealand as co-hosts was announced on June 25, 2020, following a FIFA Council vote where their joint bid secured 22 votes, defeating Colombia's bid which received 13 votes[4][7][8]. As host nations, both Australia and New Zealand qualified automatically for the tournament[3].\n\n### Historic Firsts\nThis tournament was distinguished by several historical milestones:\n*   **First Co-Hosted Women's World Cup**: It was the first time the FIFA Women's World Cup was held in two different countries[1][9][5].\n*   **First in the Southern Hemisphere**: The 2023 event was the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere[4][1][10].\n*   **First Across Two Confederations**: It was the first senior FIFA tournament hosted across multiple confederations[4]. Australia is a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), while New Zealand belongs to the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)[12].\n*   **First Senior FIFA Tournament in Oceania**: The event marked the first senior FIFA tournament to be hosted in Oceania[12][4].\n\n## Venues and Impact\n\nA total of 64 matches were played in ten stadiums across nine host cities[13][14]. Australia provided six venues in five cities: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney (which had two stadiums)[1][6]. New Zealand hosted matches in four stadiums across Auckland, Dunedin, Hamilton, and Wellington[1][15].\n\nThe tournament was considered a major success, generating USD $570 million in revenue and breaking even for the first time[14]. It also had a significant social and economic impact, boosting the visibility of women's sports in both host nations[16]. In New Zealand, the event contributed NZ$109.5 million to the economy, more than double the projection, and increased viewership of women's sport by 29%[3][16]. In Australia, a survey showed that 86% of respondents believed the World Cup made the country a more enjoyable place to live[16].",

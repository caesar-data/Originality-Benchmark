  "content": "TRUE. Multiple independent surveys and data from numerous sources confirm that a significant portion of U.S. workers\u2014well over 3 in 10 (30%)\u2014do not use all of their paid time off (PTO). Recent studies from 2023 and 2024 consistently place the figure between 46% and 62%[1][2].\n\n## Supporting Data on Unused Paid Time Off\n\nA wide range of surveys conducted in recent years corroborates the finding that a substantial percentage of American workers leave PTO unused.\n\n*   **Sorbet (2023-2024):** A survey by fintech company Sorbet found that 62% of Americans with PTO did not use all of their vacation time in 2023[3]. The report highlights that this trend of unused PTO has nearly doubled in the four years prior[4][5]. The same study noted that 5.5% of American workers took no paid time off at all in 2023[3].\n*   **Pew Research Center (2023-2024):** A 2024 Pew Research Center survey reported that nearly half of American workers do not take all the vacation days they are allotted[6][7]. Specifically, a survey conducted in February 2023 found that 46% of U.S. workers with paid time off take less than they are offered[1][8]. This report was based on a survey of 5,188 U.S. adults[1].\n*   **Expedia (2024):** The 24th annual Vacation Deprivation Report from Expedia found that 53% of Americans did not use all their time off and do not plan to use it all in the current year[9]. This study surveyed 11,580 respondents across multiple countries from March 26 to April 3, 2024[9].\n*   **Eagle Hill Consulting (2024):** According to a nationwide survey, 48% of U.S. workers said they do not expect to take all of their allotted vacation days by the end of the calendar year[10].\n*   **Solitaired (2024):** A survey by Solitaired revealed that 47% of Americans left some PTO unused in 2024[11].\n\n## Reasons for Unused Paid Time Off\n\nStudies have identified several key reasons why employees do not take all their available time off. According to a Pew Research Center survey, the most cited reasons among workers who leave time on the table include:\n*   **No Perceived Need:** 52% state they don't feel they need to take more time off[1][12].\n*   **Fear of Falling Behind:** 49% worry about falling behind at work if they were to take more time off[1][12].\n*   **Guilt About Coworkers:** 43% say they would feel bad about coworkers taking on additional work[1][13]. Women (48%) are more likely than men (39%) to cite this reason[1].\n*   **Career Concerns:** Smaller shares worry that taking more time off might hurt their chances for promotion (19%) or even risk their job (16%)[12].\n\nDemographic data from Pew shows that upper-income (51%), college-educated (51%), salaried (52%), and managerial (54%) workers are more likely to take less time off than offered[1][8].\n\n## Historical and Economic Context\n\nThe trend of forgoing vacation days is not new, though it has been increasing. Research from the U.S. Travel Association, Oxford Economics, and Ipsos found that in 2018, 55% of American workers did not use all their paid time off, resulting in a record 768 million unused vacation days[14][15]. This was a 9% increase from 2017[14].\n\nOf those 768 million unused days, 236 million were forfeited completely, equating to $65.5 billion in lost benefits for employees[15][16]. This contrasts with the period from 1978 to 2000, when workers used an average of 20.3 vacation days, compared to 17.4 in 2018[17][16]. The United States remains the only advanced economy that does not federally guarantee paid vacation for its workers[18].",

  "content": "TRUE. Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson's expenditure on his life-extension system, Project Blueprint, has exceeded $4 million based on extensive reporting of his annual costs and the project's duration.\n\n## Comprehensive Spending Analysis\n\nMultiple independent reports state that Bryan Johnson spends approximately $2 million per year on Project Blueprint[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. This figure is cited for specific years, including 2023[10], and is often quoted as his ongoing annual budget for the project[11][12][13][14].\n\n### Project Timeline and Cumulative Cost\n\nProject Blueprint was initiated in 2020 or, more specifically, announced on October 13, 2021[1][15][16][17][12]. Given the project has been running for at least four years, the cumulative expenditure at an annual rate of $2 million would be approximately $8 million or more, significantly exceeding the $4 million threshold.\n\n### Direct Reporting on Development Costs\n\nSeveral sources corroborate the query's specific figure, stating that Johnson \"spent more than $4 million developing a life-extension system called Blueprint\"[18][19]. Other reports specify that he \"dedicated $4 million towards launching Blueprint\"[20] or \"spent a total of $4 million developing\" the system[21][22]. Johnson's own protocol website confirms that \"millions were spent developing Blueprint\"[23][24].\n\n### Nature of Expenses\n\nThe widely reported $2 million annual cost covers a comprehensive regimen that includes:\n*   **A team of over 30 doctors** and medical experts who monitor his bodily functions[17][25].\n*   **Advanced medical interventions** and cutting-edge tests, including regular MRIs and experimental therapies[3][26].\n*   **Scientific research**, biological data measurement, and protocol development, which Johnson notes comprised the bulk of the initial high costs[27].\n\nIn an interview, Johnson clarified that while the headline figure is $2 million, that number reflects the total cost of research, science, and measurement, whereas the cost of the actual protocol is substantially lower[27]. This confirms that significant capital was invested in development, separate from the ongoing execution costs of the diet and supplement regimen. Additionally, one source notes that Johnson transformed his home into a dedicated clinic for the project at a cost of over $6.8 million[28].",

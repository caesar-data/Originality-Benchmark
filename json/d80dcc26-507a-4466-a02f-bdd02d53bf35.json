  "content": "FALSE. The claim that Oregon farmers produce about 60% of the world's hazelnut supply is factually incorrect. The state of Oregon is the dominant producer within the United States, accounting for approximately 99% of the nation's crop[1][2][3]. However, the United States as a whole ranks third or fourth globally, and Oregon's output represents less than 10% of the world's total supply[4][5]. The global hazelnut market is overwhelmingly dominated by Turkey, which produces more than half of the world's supply[6][5][4].\n\n## Global Hazelnut Market Landscape (2023)\n\nGlobal production of in-shell hazelnuts in 2023 was approximately 1.13 million metric tons[5]. Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) confirms a total of 1,125,221 metric tons for the year[5][7].\n\nTurkey is the undisputed leader in hazelnut production, a position it has held for many years[6][8]. In 2023, Turkey's output was 650,000 metric tons, accounting for 57.77% of the world's total supply[5][4]. Other sources place its market share even higher, at 58% to 71% for the same year[5][6]. The country's production has a significant impact on global prices and supply chains[6].\n\nThe leading hazelnut-producing nations for 2023 are ranked as follows:\n\n| Rank | Country | Production (Metric Tons) | Share of World Production (%) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Turkey | 650,000 | 57.77% |\n| 2 | Italy | 102,740 | 9.13% |\n| 3 | United States | 85,460 | 7.59% |\n| 4 | Azerbaijan | 75,409 | 6.70% |\n| 5 | Chile | 65,647 | 5.83% |\n| 6 | Georgia | 36,900 | 3.28% |\n*Source: Production data from FAOSTAT and Tridge intelligence reports for the 2023 calendar year*[5][4].\n\n## Oregon's Production in Context\n\nOregon's role, while dominant within the U.S., is significantly smaller on the global stage.\n\n### Production Volume\n\nAccording to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, Oregon growers produced 94,200 tons of in-shell hazelnuts in 2023[9]. This figure is equivalent to approximately 85,456 metric tons (one ton equals roughly 0.907 metric tons)[10]. This production level aligns closely with the total U.S. output of 85,460 metric tons reported by FAOSTAT for 2023, reflecting the fact that Oregon produces about 99% of the U.S. hazelnut crop[5][1]. Industry estimates for Oregon's 2023 crop were even higher, ranging from 95,000 to over 101,000 tons[11][12].\n\n### Global Market Share Calculation\n\nBased on the official 2023 figures, Oregon's share of global hazelnut production can be calculated as:\n\n(85,456 Metric Tons from Oregon / 1,125,221 Metric Tons Worldwide) x 100 = **7.59%**\n\nThis calculated share is consistent with sources stating the U.S. contributes between 3% and 8% to the world's supply[2][4][13]. This is nearly eight times lower than the incorrect 60% figure in the query.\n\nIn summary, while Oregon is the heart of the U.S. hazelnut industry, its output constitutes a single-digit percentage of the global total. Turkey remains the world's primary source of hazelnuts by a substantial margin[6].",

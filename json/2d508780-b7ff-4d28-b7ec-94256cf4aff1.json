  "content": "**FALSE**: The claim that Cristiano Ronaldo retired from professional football in January 2023 is factually incorrect. In January 2023, he began a new chapter of his career by signing with the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and continues to play professionally for both his club and the Portugal national team as of October 2025.\n\n## January 2023 Transfer to Al Nassr\n\nInstead of retiring, Cristiano Ronaldo joined the Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in January 2023 after his contract with Manchester United was terminated[1][2]. The agreement was reached on December 30, 2022, for him to join the club effective January 1, 2023[3][4][5]. He was officially presented as an Al Nassr player in Riyadh on January 3, 2023[6][7].\n\nAt the unveiling, Ronaldo stated that his work in Europe was \"done\" and that he had turned down multiple offers from clubs in Europe, North and South America, and Australia to take on this new challenge[6][7][8].\n\n### Contract and Salary Details\n\nRonaldo's initial contract with Al Nassr was a two-and-a-half-year deal valid until the summer of 2025[9][4][10]. The deal reportedly made him the highest-paid footballer in history[3]. Reports on his earnings varied, with figures cited at:\n*   **$75 million per year** guaranteed for on-field services, with commercial agreements potentially increasing the total to around $200 million[6][11].\n*   **\u20ac200 million per year** (approximately $211 million) total, inclusive of all commercial and sponsorship deals[7][3][12]. This figure included a guaranteed annual football salary of \u20ac90 million[13][3].\n*   **More than \u00a3177 million per year**[10].\n*   **$225 million annually** under a new deal signed in 2025[14].\n\n## Continued Professional Career (2023\u2013Present)\n\nSince joining Al Nassr, Ronaldo has been an active and prolific player. As of 2025, his goal-scoring record for the club is substantial:\n*   He has scored 104 goals in 117 total appearances[15].\n*   He has scored 103 goals in 116 matches[14].\n*   He scored 96 goals in his first 105 appearances[9].\n\nFor the 2025-26 season specifically, he has started 4 games, scoring 4 goals and recording 28 shots[16][17].\n\n### Contract Extension to 2027\n\nDemonstrating his long-term commitment, Cristiano Ronaldo, now 40, signed a new two-year contract with Al Nassr in June 2025[14][18]. This extension keeps him with the Saudi club until June 30, 2027, when he will be 42 years old[19][20][3].\n\n## Ongoing International Career\n\nRonaldo's professional career also continues at the international level, where he remains captain of the Portugal national team[3]. In October 2025, he was called up for Portugal's World Cup 2026 qualifying matches against Ireland and Hungary[21][22]. He joined the team for training and is expected to lead the country at the 2026 World Cup[21][23][24].",

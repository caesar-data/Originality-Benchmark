The most sensitive thresholds reported in the provided sources are in the range of 37 to 43 ppb, while the majority of sources place the average detection level between 1 and 50 parts per million (ppm), which is equivalent to 1,000 to 50,000 ppb. The claim of a 5 ppb threshold is factually incorrect and likely stems from a misunderstanding of the commonly cited 5 ppm threshold.\n\n## Assessment of Ammonia's Odor Detection Threshold\n\nThe odor detection threshold is the minimum concentration of a substance that the human sense of smell can perceive[1]. This value can vary significantly among individuals and based on the measurement methodology used[2][3]. For ammonia, there is no scientific consensus on a single value, but a wide range of thresholds has been established through numerous studies[4].\n\n### Reported Threshold Ranges\n\nThe provided research consistently places the odor detection threshold for ammonia well above 5 ppb.\n\n*   **Lowest Reported Values:** The most sensitive, or lowest, reported detection thresholds for ammonia are 0.037 ppm (37 ppb) and 0.04 ppm (40 ppb)[5][6][7]. Another study cites a low-end value of 43 ppb[8]. These figures are the closest to the claim but are still more than seven times higher than 5 ppb.\n\n*   **Commonly Cited Ranges (in ppm):** Most governmental and safety organizations report the threshold in parts per million (ppm), which are orders of magnitude higher than 5 ppb (1 ppm = 1,000 ppb).\n    *   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states the range is between 5 and 50 ppm (5,000 to 50,000 ppb)[9][10][11].\n    *   The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) cites a range of 5 to 53 ppm (5,000 to 53,000 ppb) and notes the pungent smell is detectable at concentrations as low as 5 ppm[12][13].\n    *   Other sources report mean or typical thresholds of 1.5 ppm (1,500 ppb), 2.6 ppm (2,600 ppb), and 17 ppm (17,000 ppb)[14][15][2][6].\n    *   A field study following accidental releases found that of over 6,500 air samples taken between 0 and 1 ppm, an odor was detected in only 3.2% of cases, suggesting the threshold is typically above 1 ppm[4].\n\n### Context of Background Ammonia Levels\n\nThe implausibility of a 5 ppb odor threshold is further supported by data on typical ambient ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is typically present in indoor air at concentrations between 10 and 70 ppb[14]. If the human nose could detect ammonia at 5 ppb, its pungent odor would be a constant presence in most indoor environments, which is contrary to common experience.\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Potent Odorants\n\nWhile ammonia has a strong, pungent odor, its detection threshold is not considered exceptionally low when compared to other highly potent chemical odorants, particularly sulfur-containing compounds[17][18]. These substances establish the benchmark for what is considered a \"tiny\" concentration in olfaction science.\n\n### Chemicals with Ultra-Low Thresholds\n\nSeveral chemicals are detectable by the human nose at concentrations far below the lowest reported thresholds for ammonia.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Sulfide ($\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$):** Often described as smelling like rotten eggs, it can be detected at concentrations as low as 0.00047 ppm, or 0.47 ppb[19].\n*   **Ethyl Mercaptan:** This is the odorant added to natural gas to serve as a warning agent. Its odor threshold has been reported as low as 0.00014 ppm (0.14 ppb)[20].\n*   **Geosmin:** This organic compound, responsible for the earthy smell after rain, has one of the lowest known thresholds at 6.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 ppm, which is equivalent to 0.0065 ppb[17][18].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that the most potent odorants can be detected at sub-ppb levels, placing them in a different category of olfactory sensitivity compared to ammonia, whose lowest documented threshold is approximately 37 ppb[5][20].",

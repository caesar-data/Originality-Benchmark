  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe statement that Britpop band Blur announced they would be playing a one-off gig at Wembley in 2023 is factually correct based on the initial public announcements[1][2]. However, a second date was subsequently added, and the band ultimately performed on two consecutive nights[3][4].\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### The Initial Announcement\nOn November 14, 2022, Blur officially announced a reunion concert scheduled for Saturday, July 8, 2023, at London's Wembley Stadium[3][5]. This event was widely reported as the band's first headline show since 2015 and their first-ever performance at the iconic venue[2][1][6].\n\nInitial press coverage and official statements from the event promoter, Metropolis Music, consistently described the concert as a singular event[7]:\n*   News outlets referred to it as a \"one-off UK reunion gig\" and \"their only UK appearance\"[2][6].\n*   *The Guardian* headlined its report: \"Blur to reunite for one-off Wembley show next year\"[1].\n*   *The Daily Mail* reported the band was returning \"for one night only on Saturday 8 July, 2023\"[8].\n\nBand members expressed their excitement for the single date in the announcement. Bassist Alex James stated, \"It\u2019s nice to think that on July 8 that room will be Wembley Stadium\"[2][9].\n\n### Expansion to a Two-Night Event\nWhile the initial plan was for a single concert, a second performance was added for Sunday, July 9, 2023[4][9]. The two shows were the biggest of the band's career, with a combined attendance of over 150,000 fans[10][11][12]. In a later interview, frontman Damon Albarn confirmed that Blur \"chose to perform two sold-out shows at Wembley during their comeback in 2023\"[13].\n\n### Commemoration of the Concerts\nThe weekend event was commemorated with a live album and concert film, both titled `blur: Live at Wembley Stadium`[14][10]. Marketing materials for these releases explicitly state that the content was \"captured across two unforgettable nights\"[15][10]. The film was released in UK and Irish cinemas on September 6, 2024, with the live album released on July 26, 2024[16][10].\n\nThe support acts differed for each night[3][7]:\n*   **Saturday, July 8:** Self Esteem, Sleaford Mods, and Jockstrap[7].\n*   **Sunday, July 9:** Paul Weller and The Selecter[7].\n\nIn conclusion, the original statement is accurate as it describes the initial announcement of a single, \"one-off\" concert. The subsequent addition of a second date does not invalidate the factual nature of how the event was first presented to the public.",

Blur, on the other hand, only chose to perform two sold-out shows at Wembley during their comeback in 2023.\n\n\u201cNostalgia\u2019s OK but I try and stay away from it as much as possible.

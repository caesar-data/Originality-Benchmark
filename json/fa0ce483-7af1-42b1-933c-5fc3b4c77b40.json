  "content": "TRUE. The statement is factual; the 2023 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest was held in Liverpool, United Kingdom[1][2][3]. The 67th iteration of the contest took place at the Liverpool Arena, also known as the M&S Bank Arena, with the Grand Final held on May 13, 2023[4][5][2].\n\n## Host City Selection Process\n\nThe United Kingdom was selected to host the 2023 contest on behalf of the 2022 winner, Ukraine[6]. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the competition's organizer, concluded that Ukraine was unable to host due to security concerns following the Russian invasion[8][6]. Consequently, the BBC, as the broadcaster for the runner-up country in 2022, was invited to stage the event[6][9].\n\nA competitive bidding process ensued to determine the host city[2]:\n*   **Initial Bids**: Over 20 cities and towns across the UK initially expressed interest in hosting[2][10].\n*   **Shortlist of Seven**: On August 12, 2022, the BBC and EBU announced a shortlist of seven cities: Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, and Sheffield[11][12][2].\n*   **Final Two**: On September 27, 2022, the field was narrowed to two final contenders: Glasgow and Liverpool[12][11][10].\n*   **Final Decision**: Liverpool was officially announced as the host city on October 7, 2022[4][1][2]. The city's bid was noted for its strong cultural offer reflecting Ukraine's 2022 win, venue facilities, and infrastructure capable of accommodating the large-scale event[4][5].\n\n## Event Details and Venue\n\n*   **Venue**: The contest was held at the Liverpool Arena (M&S Bank Arena), an 11,000-capacity venue located on the River Mersey waterfront[1][8][2]. The arena is part of the ACC Liverpool campus, which also includes an exhibition and convention center, providing necessary space for the press center and other logistical requirements[13].\n*   **Dates**: The event schedule included two semi-finals on Tuesday, May 9 and Thursday, May 11, 2023, culminating in the Grand Final on Saturday, May 13, 2023[4][5].\n*   **Theme and Winner**: The slogan for the contest was \"United By Music\"[14][15]. The official logo incorporated the Ukrainian flag within a heart to signify that the event was hosted on behalf of Ukraine[4]. Loreen from Sweden was the winner with her song \"Tattoo\"[15][14][16].\n*   **Economic Impact**: The event brought an estimated gross local spend of \u00a354.9 million to Liverpool from visitors[9].\n\nThis was the ninth time the United Kingdom had hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, and the first time in 25 years[2][4].",

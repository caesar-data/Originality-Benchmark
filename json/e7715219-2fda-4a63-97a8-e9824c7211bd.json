  "content": "TRUE. Multiple reports and data releases from United Nations bodies in 2022 and 2023 projected that India would surpass China as the world's most populous country during 2023[1][2][3]. This demographic shift marks the first time China has not held the top position since the UN began keeping population records in 1950[4][5][6].\n\n## Confirmation of the Demographic Shift\n\nThe projection was confirmed by several United Nations agencies through various reports and policy briefs, which provided specific population estimates and timelines for the crossover event[7][8].\n\n### United Nations Projections and Timelines\n\nThe United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) issued a policy brief on April 24, 2023, stating that India's population was expected to reach 1,425,775,850 people by the end of April 2023, at which point it would match and then surpass the population of mainland China[7][9][10].\n\nSimilarly, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released its \"State of World Population Report, 2023,\" which projected that by mid-2023, India's population would be 1.4286 billion, compared to China's 1.4257 billion[4][12][13]. This would place India's population ahead of China's by approximately 2.9 million people[14][16].\n\nUN officials cautioned that the specific date of the crossover is approximate and subject to revision, as it relies on projections and estimates[7][10]. The uncertainty is partly due to the fact that India's last official census was conducted in 2011, with the 2021 census being delayed[18][13]. John Wilmoth, director of the UN's population division, noted, \"The precise timing of this crossover isn't known, and it will never be known\".\n\n### Contrasting Demographic Trajectories\n\nThis historic shift is the result of differing long-term population trends in the two countries[7].\n*   **China's Population**: China's population reached its peak of 1.426 billion in 2022 and began to decline for the first time in decades. Projections indicate that China's population will continue to fall, potentially dropping below 1 billion before the end of the century[7]. By 2050, its population is projected to be around 1.317 billion[23][24].\n*   **India's Population**: India's population is expected to continue growing for several more decades[7]. While its growth rate has slowed from an average of 1.7% in the decade after 2001 to 1.2% since 2011, the population is projected to peak at approximately 1.7 billion in 2064[25]. By 2050, India is projected to have a population of 1.668 billion[23][24].\n\nThis demographic dividend presents India with a large youth population, with 254 million people aged 15-24, which could help fuel future economic growth.",

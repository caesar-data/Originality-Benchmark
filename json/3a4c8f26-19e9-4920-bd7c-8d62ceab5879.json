  "content": "FALSE. The United Nations did not declare 2023 as the International Year of Rice; it declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets[1][2][3]. The International Year of Rice was observed in 2004[4][5].\n\n## United Nations Designation for 2023: International Year of Millets\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly, in its 75th session in March 2021, adopted resolution A/RES/75/263, officially declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets[1][6][7][8].\n\n### Key Details of the Declaration\n*   **Proposal and Support**: The resolution was proposed by the Government of India and received support from over 70 countries, including Russia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, and Senegal[9][10][11][12][13]. The proposal was unanimously approved by 193 members of the UN General Assembly[13].\n*   **Objectives**: The primary goals of the designation were to increase public awareness of the health, nutritional, and environmental benefits of millets[14][15]. The UN highlighted the crop's climate resilience, its potential to diversify the global food system, and its suitability for cultivation in drought conditions[2][3][9].\n*   **Lead Agency**: The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was designated as the lead agency to facilitate the year's observances and activities[15][6].\n\nIn addition to the International Year of Millets, the UN also declared 2023 as the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace[1].\n\n## United Nations Designation: International Year of Rice, 2004\n\nThe United Nations designated **2004** as the International Year of Rice[4][5][16]. This was the first time in UN history that an international year was dedicated to a single crop[18][19].\n\n### Key Details of the Declaration\n*   **Resolution and Timing**: The UN General Assembly declared 2004 the International Year of Rice on December 16, 2002, through resolution A/RES/57/162[4][20][21]. The initiative first began in 1999 with a collaboration between the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the FAO[4][22].\n*   **Proposal and Support**: The request was formally submitted to the UN General Assembly by the delegation of the Philippines and was co-sponsored by 43 other nations[4][22][18].\n*   **Objectives**: The campaign, under the motto \"Rice is Life,\" aimed to raise global awareness of the critical role rice plays in providing food security, alleviating poverty, and contributing to cultural heritage[18][23][16]. Rice is the staple food for over half the world's population, and rice-based systems provide employment for nearly a billion people in developing countries[4][22].\n*   **Lead Agency**: The FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the year's activities in collaboration with governments and other organizations[4].",

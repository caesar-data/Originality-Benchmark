  "content": "FALSE. Scientific research overwhelmingly indicates that hunger does not decrease negative emotions; rather, it is strongly associated with an increase in negative emotions like anger and irritability. Furthermore, the evidence regarding hunger's effect on positive emotions is mixed, with the majority of studies showing that hunger decreases positive affect or has no significant effect.\n\n## Comprehensive Analysis of Hunger and Emotional States\n\nThe relationship between hunger and emotion is complex, involving psychological responses, physiological states, and hormonal regulation. Extensive research has focused on the colloquial concept of being \"hangry\"\u2014irritable or angry due to hunger\u2014and has largely substantiated this experience, directly contradicting the user's query [1][2].\n\n### Impact on Negative Emotions: The 'Hangry' Phenomenon\n\nThe claim that hunger decreases negative emotions is unsupported by the provided evidence. In contrast, multiple studies demonstrate a robust positive correlation between hunger and negative emotional states.\n\n*   **Increased Anger and Irritability**: A field-based study published in *PLOS ONE* is the first to examine the \"hangry\" effect in a day-to-day environment [1][3]. Researchers collected 9,142 responses from 64 adults over a 21-day period and found that greater levels of self-reported hunger were significantly associated with more intense feelings of anger and irritability [4][2]. The effects were substantial, with hunger accounting for 34% of the variance in anger and 37% of the variance in irritability [1][3][5]. These associations remained significant even after controlling for demographic factors such as age, sex, BMI, and personality traits [6][2].\n*   **Broader Negative Affect**: Other studies corroborate these findings. A 2022 study by Ackermans et al. randomly assigned women to either a 14-hour fasting condition or a satiated condition and found that hungry women reported significantly higher overall negative emotions, including increased tension, anger, fatigue, and confusion [7][8]. Similarly, research on early adolescents revealed that missing meals was linked to increased negative affect; specifically, missing breakfast was associated with a 0.36-point increase and missing lunch with a 0.52-point increase in negative affect scores [9].\n*   **Psychological Mechanisms**: Hunger can induce a negative context that influences perceptions [10]. Research from the University of North Carolina found that hungry participants were more likely to interpret ambiguous stimuli as negative, but only after being primed with a negative image [10]. Hungry individuals also reported greater feelings of stress and hatefulness when they were not explicitly focused on their emotions [10][11]. The release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline due to low blood sugar can also contribute to irritability and aggression [12][13].\n\n### Impact on Positive Emotions: Contradictory and Nuanced Findings\n\nThe claim that hunger increases positive emotions is also largely contradicted by scientific literature, although a few studies suggest a more complex relationship.\n\n*   **Decreased Positive Affect**: The majority of studies show a negative correlation. The widely-cited *PLOS ONE* study found that hunger was associated with lower ratings of pleasure, accounting for 38% of the variance in this measure [14][1]. The Ackermans et al. study similarly found that hungry women reported lower positive emotions, specifically lower vigor and marginally lower esteem-related affect, compared to satiated women [7][15]. The study on adolescents found that missing lunch was related to a 0.80-point decrease in positive affect [9].\n*   **Evidence for Increased Positive States**: Some research offers a contrary perspective. A large-scale Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study found that greater hunger intensity was prospectively associated with an increase in feeling \"active\" (coefficient 0.029) and \"lively\" (coefficient 0.019) [16]. The authors concluded that in a community-based sample, hunger may lead toward some positive psychological states [16]. Another study noted that \"feelings of reward and achievement\" increased with greater fasting time in normal-weight women [17].\n*   **Contextual Factors**: The relationship may be moderated by underlying conditions. One study noted that women with symptoms of eating disorders experienced more positive feelings when hungry than women without such symptoms, suggesting a \"relearned\" association of hunger as a positive experience in this specific group [15]. This highlights that any positive association is not universal and may be linked to psychopathology.\n\n### Physiological Mechanisms: The Complex Role of Ghrelin\n\nGhrelin, known as the \"hunger hormone,\" is central to the physiological regulation of appetite and has been investigated for its role in mood, though findings are inconsistent [18][19].\n\n*   **Antidepressant and Anxiolytic Potential**: Some animal studies suggest that ghrelin has mood-buffering properties. Research has found that elevated ghrelin levels, which can be induced by stress or calorie restriction, produce antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like behavioral adaptations in mice [18][19][20]. Exogenous ghrelin injections have also demonstrated these effects [21]. This suggests a potential mechanism where the hormone ghrelin, released during hunger, could help individuals cope with stress [22].\n*   **Contradictory and Pro-Anxiety Evidence**: The scientific literature on ghrelin's mood effects is far from settled. Several studies have found that ghrelin can have anxiogenic (anxiety-promoting) effects [19][18]. For instance, one study found that chronic central nervous system exposure to ghrelin increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in rats [23]. This has led researchers to propose two opposing models: one where rising ghrelin contributes to stress-induced depression and anxiety, and another where it helps minimize these effects [24][20]. Overall, the evidence from human studies remains sparse and inconclusive [25]. The complex and often contradictory findings on ghrelin do not support a simple conclusion that hunger decreases negative emotions.",

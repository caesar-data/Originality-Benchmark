  "content": "FALSE. The 2023 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest was not held in Oslo, Norway [1][2][3]. The 67th edition of the contest took place in Liverpool, United Kingdom [1][2][3][4].\n\n## Host City and Country Selection\n\nTraditionally, the winning country of the previous year's contest hosts the event [4]. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 contest with their song \"Stefania,\" making Ukraine the designated host for 2023 [4][5].\n\nHowever, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) conducted a security assessment and concluded that for safety and security reasons, the event could not be held in Ukraine [4][7][8][9]. The EBU then invited the United Kingdom's broadcaster, the BBC, to host the 2023 contest, as the UK's entry, Sam Ryder, had finished as the runner-up in 2022 [4][5][10]. On July 25, 2022, it was officially confirmed that the UK would host the event on behalf of Ukraine [11][12].\n\n## The Bidding Process\n\nFollowing the confirmation that the UK would host, the BBC launched a bidding process to select the host city [4][11]. More than 20 cities initially responded, with seven being shortlisted in August 2022: Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, and Sheffield [2][4]. The field was narrowed down to two finalists, Glasgow and Liverpool, in September 2022 [13][2].\n\nOn October 7, 2022, the EBU and BBC announced Liverpool as the official host city [3][14][8]. Liverpool was chosen based on its venue facilities, capacity to accommodate visitors, infrastructure, and a cultural offer that reflected Ukraine's 2022 victory [15][8].\n\n## Event Details\n\n*   **Venue**: The contest was held at the Liverpool Arena, also known as the M&S Bank Arena, located next to the River Mersey [1][2][14].\n*   **Dates**: The semi-finals took place on May 9 and 11, 2023, with the Grand Final on Saturday, May 13, 2023 [7][2][8].\n*   **Hosts**: The show was presented by Alesha Dixon, Hannah Waddingham, Julia Sanina, and Graham Norton [2][14][16].\n*   **Theme**: The theme for the event was \"United by Music\" [2][14].\n\nThis marked the ninth time the UK has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, a record for any country [7][17].",

  "content": "FALSE. While DNA from million-year-old mammoth teeth was once the oldest ever sequenced, that record was broken in 2022. The current record for the world's oldest DNA is approximately 2 million years old and was recovered from environmental sediment in Greenland[1][2][3].\n\n## The Current Record Holder: 2-Million-Year-Old Environmental DNA\n\nIn December 2022, researchers announced the discovery of the oldest DNA ever recovered, dating back approximately 2 million years[2][4]. This genetic material was not extracted from a single fossilized specimen but was environmental DNA (eDNA) found preserved in Ice Age sediment from the Kap K\u00f8benhavn Formation in northern Greenland[5][6].\n\nThis eDNA consists of microscopic fragments shed by numerous organisms into the environment, which were then preserved in permafrost[6][7]. The analysis of this 2-million-year-old genetic material revealed a complex ancient ecosystem that included mastodons, reindeer, hares, geese, and various plants like poplar and birch trees, which is inconsistent with the polar desert environment found there today[4][1][2]. This discovery surpassed the previous record by approximately one million years[8][9].\n\n## The Previous Record: Million-Year-Old Mammoth DNA\n\nPrior to the Greenland discovery, the statement in the query was factual. In February 2021, scientists announced they had successfully sequenced DNA from three mammoth molars recovered from the Siberian permafrost[10][11][12].\n\n### Age and Significance\nThe ages of these mammoth specimens were estimated to be between 700,000 and 1.2 million years old, with some dating methods suggesting the oldest, named Krestovka, could be as old as 1.65 million years[13][10][14].\n\nAt the time, this discovery shattered the previous record for the oldest DNA, which belonged to a horse that lived between 560,000 and 780,000 years ago[15][16][17]. The mammoth DNA provided crucial insights into mammoth evolution, including the identification of a previously unknown lineage and the discovery that the Columbian mammoth was a hybrid[18][10].\n\n## Summary of Key Findings\n\n| Record                                 | Age                    | Source                                          | Type of DNA              | Year Announced |\n| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |\n| **Current Oldest DNA**                 | ~2 million years       | Sediment from Kap K\u00f8benhavn Formation, Greenland[19] | Environmental DNA (eDNA) | 2022           |\n| **Previous Record Holder (Mammoth)** | 1.0 - 1.65 million years | Mammoth molars from Siberian permafrost[13][14] | From physical specimen   | 2021           |\n| **Prior Record Holder (Horse)**        | ~560,000\u2013780,000 years | Horse fossil from Yukon, Canada[16][17] | From physical specimen   | 2013           |\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the world's oldest DNA comes from million-year-old mammoth teeth is outdated. While this was a landmark achievement that held the record, it has been superseded by the discovery of significantly older environmental DNA from Greenland[1][2].",

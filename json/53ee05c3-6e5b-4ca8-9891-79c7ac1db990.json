  "content": "TRUE. Numerous scientific studies and real-world pilot programs confirm that working dogs can be, and have been, trained to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans by sniffing sweat samples[1][2][3]. This capability has been demonstrated in laboratory settings and deployed for screening in public venues such as airports and sporting events[4][5][6].\n\n## Scientific Basis and Training Methodology\n\nThe ability of dogs to detect COVID-19 is based on the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters a person's metabolic processes, resulting in the release of a unique pattern of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)[8][1]. These VOCs contribute to an individual's body odor and can be excreted through various bodily fluids, including sweat, making the infection's scent signature detectable to a dog's highly sensitive olfactory system[3][9]. Dogs possess over 220 million olfactory receptors, compared to approximately five million in humans, enabling them to detect these subtle scent changes[3][10].\n\n### Sample Collection and Training Protocols\nResearch programs have utilized a variety of non-invasive methods to collect sweat samples for training and testing, including:\n*   **Axillary Swabs**: Sterile surgical swabs or cotton pads are held under the armpit for several minutes[11][12][13].\n*   **Worn Clothing**: Volunteers wear items like T-shirts or socks overnight to absorb sweat, which are then used as scent samples[14][15][16].\n*   **Skin Wipes**: Passengers at some venues are asked to dab their skin with a wipe to provide a sample[17].\n\nTraining is typically based on operant conditioning, where dogs are rewarded for correctly identifying sweat samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals[8][19]. Dogs learn to discriminate between positive and negative samples presented in containers or olfaction cones within a line-up[11][12]. The training period can range from one week for experienced detection dogs to several months for \"green\" dogs with no prior scent work[20][19][3].\n\n## Diagnostic Accuracy and Performance Metrics\n\nMultiple studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of canine olfaction for COVID-19 detection using sweat samples, often comparing it to the \"gold standard\" RT-PCR test. The reported accuracy varies by study, dog, and viral variant, but has consistently shown high levels of success.\n\n### Key Performance Findings:\n*   **Overall High Accuracy**: A French study involving 335 individuals found that dogs detected SARS-CoV-2 from sweat with 97% sensitivity and 91% specificity compared to RT-PCR tests[21][22].\n*   **Asymptomatic Detection**: The same French study noted that dogs achieved 100% sensitivity in identifying asymptomatic cases[21][23]. A separate pilot study also reported high accuracy in detecting asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals[24].\n*   **Mass Screening Performance**: In a German study conducted at four concerts with 2,802 participants, trained dogs screened sweat samples and correctly identified infections with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of nearly 100%[25][26].\n*   **Variable Success Rates**: A proof-of-concept study in France and Lebanon reported success rates for individual dogs ranging from 76% to 100%[11][1]. A field study in Mexico found its two best-performing dogs reached sensitivity of 76% and 80%, with specificity of 75% and 88%, respectively[27][3].\n*   **Impact of Viral Variants**: A study in Rwanda demonstrated a significant difference in performance between COVID-19 waves. During the Delta variant wave, sensitivity ranged from 75.0% to 89.9%. However, during the Omicron wave, sensitivity decreased substantially to 36.6%\u201341.5%, while specificity remained high at over 95%[12][28].\n*   **Comparison to Antigen Tests**: Canine detection has demonstrated higher sensitivity than rapid antigen tests (97% vs. 84% in one study), though specificity was sometimes lower[21][23]. This makes dogs a viable, non-invasive alternative for mass screening[22][29].\n\n## Real-World Applications and Deployments\n\nBased on promising study results, canine screening programs using sweat samples have been deployed in several public venues worldwide as a rapid, non-invasive screening tool[30].\n*   **Airports**: Dogs have been used to screen arriving passengers at airports in Helsinki, Finland; Dubai, UAE; and Beirut, Lebanon[4][31][32][33]. Miami International Airport also launched a pilot program to screen employees[5][34].\n*   **Sporting Events**: The Miami Heat (NBA) used sniffer dogs to screen fans before games, and NASCAR deployed dogs on a trial basis at a race event[6][33].\n*   **Other Public Venues**: Researchers have consistently proposed using dogs in high-traffic areas such as schools, concert venues, and public transport hubs to quickly screen large numbers of people[35][36]. Two trained dogs can screen a plane of 300 people in about 30 minutes[37][38].\n\n## Detection Beyond Acute Infection\n\nA notable extension of this research involves the detection of Long COVID. A study tested 45 patients experiencing prolonged symptoms for an average of 15.2 months post-infection[39][40]. Trained dogs positively identified 23 of the 45 (51.1%) Long COVID patients from sweat samples, compared to zero identifications among 188 healthy controls[10][40]. This finding suggests that some Long COVID patients may have persistent viral antigens that produce a detectable scent signature long after the acute phase of illness[39][41].",

  "content": "TRUE. Nevada authorizes and actively uses controlled burns, officially known as prescribed fires, as a key strategy to manage vegetation, reduce hazardous fuels, and prevent catastrophic wildfires. This practice is codified in state law, implemented by state and federal agencies, and supported by a framework of regulations, inter-agency partnerships, and public education programs.\n\n## State-Level Authorization and Programs\n\nThe use of prescribed fire in Nevada is formally governed by state law, specifically Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 527.122-128[1]. The Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF) explicitly lists prescribed fire as a land management tool under its Forest Stewardship Program[2]. The goal of these burns is to reduce flammable fuels, which in turn can lower the threat of catastrophic wildfires in the treated areas[1].\n\nTo ensure safety and effectiveness, any prescribed fire implemented by the state must adhere to strict requirements[1]:\n*   **Written Plan**: The burn must follow a detailed, written plan prepared by a qualified person[1].\n*   **Technical Review**: The plan must undergo a technical review by a qualified burn boss from outside the NDF[1].\n*   **Official Approval**: All plans require authorization from the State Fire Management Officer and the State Forester/Firewarden before implementation[1].\n*   **On-Site Supervision**: A qualified burn boss must be on-site to directly supervise the entire duration of the fire[1].\n\nNevada has also established a supportive legal environment for this practice. It was the first western state to pass a law limiting the liability of prescribed burn managers to a \"gross negligence\" standard for escaped fires, a measure that protects certified practitioners who take proper precautions[3][4].\n\n## Implementation and Inter-Agency Collaboration\n\nPrescribed burning in Nevada is executed through the coordinated efforts of state, federal, and local partners.\n*   **Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF)**: NDF is an active participant in prescribed fire operations. It works with the Tahoe Fire & Fuels Team (TFFT) on fuel reduction projects, including pile burning, around Lake Tahoe[5][6][7]. The NDF also coordinates the Fire Adapted Nevada program to promote wildfire resilience statewide[8].\n*   **Bureau of Land Management (BLM)**: The BLM, which manages vast tracts of land in Nevada, routinely conducts prescribed burns to reduce hazardous fuels. Projects have been planned and executed across the state, including a 209-acre pile burn in Douglas County, a four-acre research burn in Washoe County, and thousands of acres of piled juniper burns near Vya in northwest Nevada[10][11][12]. These burns are part of a broader strategy to create up to 11,000 miles of fuel breaks in the Great Basin to improve firefighter safety and control the spread of wildfires[13][14]. Over the last decade, prescribed fire methods accounted for approximately 25% of the 600,000 to 900,000 acres the BLM treats annually[15].\n*   **U.S. Forest Service**: Federal partners like the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest use prescribed fire to reduce fuel loading and promote forest health, treating an average of 3,000 acres per year, with a range of 2,000 to 8,000 acres in recent years[16].\n\n## Regulatory and Management Framework\n\nA comprehensive regulatory and public information system supports the use of prescribed fire in Nevada.\n*   **Smoke Management**: The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) runs the Nevada Smoke Management Program to coordinate open burning and ensure compliance with air quality standards under NRS 445B.100-845[17]. Burn managers must obtain permits from state or local air quality districts to mitigate smoke impacts and meet Clean Air Act requirements[16].\n*   **Public Information**: The state utilizes the NV-RxFire information repository to provide public updates on active prescribed burns[18].\n*   **Education and Training**: Organizations like the Nevada County Resource Conservation District offer educational programs and hands-on workshops for private landowners on the basics of prescribed burning, including how to develop a burn plan, manage smoke, and obtain permits[19]. This is complemented by state-level initiatives like the Fire Adapted Nevada program, which aims to create ignition-resistant communities through collaboration between agencies and residents[20].",

  "content": "**FALSE**: The statement that Greta Gerwig's *Barbie* had the biggest debut ever for a film directed by a woman with a $356 million opening weekend is factually incorrect because it omits the critical qualifier \"solely.\" While the box office figure is accurate, the film's debut was surpassed by *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was co-directed by a woman. *Barbie* set the record for the biggest worldwide opening weekend for a film **solely** directed by a woman.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\nThe assertion contains two distinct claims: a specific financial figure and a record-setting achievement. A detailed examination of box office data reveals nuances that render the overall statement false as written.\n\n### Component 1: Opening Weekend Gross ($356 Million)\n\nThe claim that *Barbie* earned $356 million in its opening weekend is **accurate**. Initial estimates for the film's global debut were around $337 million[1][2][3]. However, updated reports with box office actuals confirmed the higher figure of $356 million[4][5].\n\n*   **Domestic Opening (U.S. & Canada)**: $162,022,044[6][7].\n*   **International Opening**: $194.3 million from 69 markets[8].\n*   **Total Worldwide Opening**: $356.3 million[10].\n\n### Component 2: Biggest Debut for a Female-Directed Film\n\nThe claim that *Barbie*'s debut was the \"biggest ever for a film directed by a woman\" is **false** without qualification. The record for the largest worldwide opening for a film involving a female director belongs to *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck[11].\n\n*Captain Marvel* significantly outperformed *Barbie*'s global debut, earning approximately $100 million more in its opening weekend.\n\n| Film | Director(s) | Worldwide Opening Weekend Gross | Sources |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Captain Marvel** (2019) | Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck | **~$456 million** | [12][13][10][14] |\n| **Barbie** (2023) | Greta Gerwig (sole director) | **~$356 million** | [4][5][10] |\n\n*Barbie*'s achievement is correctly stated as the biggest worldwide opening for a film **solely directed by a woman**[15]. Globally, its opening was the second-best for a movie from a female filmmaker, behind *Captain Marvel*[3][17].\n\n### Other Notable Records Set by *Barbie*\n\nWhile it did not secure the overall record for a female-directed film's worldwide opening, *Barbie*'s debut was historic and broke numerous other records:\n\n*   **Biggest Domestic Opening for a Female Director**: With a domestic gross of $162 million, *Barbie* surpassed the previous record held by *Captain Marvel* ($153.4 million), making it the top domestic debut for a film directed or co-directed by a woman[18][3][19].\n*   **Biggest Opening Weekend of 2023**: Its domestic opening of $162 million surpassed *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* ($146 million) to become the largest of the year[20][11].\n*   **First Film Directed Solely by a Woman to Gross $1 Billion**: The film went on to surpass $1 billion at the global box office, a first for a movie with a solo female director[21].\n*   **Highest-Grossing Film of 2023**: *Barbie* ultimately grossed over $1.447 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2023[8][6].",

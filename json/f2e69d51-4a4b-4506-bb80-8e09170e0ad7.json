  "content": "TRUE. Japan uses two distinct methods for counting a person's age: the modern, internationally recognized system called *man nenrei* (\u6e80\u5e74\u9f62), and a traditional system known as *kazoedoshi* (\u6570\u3048\u5e74)[1][2][3]. While *man nenrei* is the official and standard method for daily life, *kazoedoshi* remains in use for specific traditional ceremonies and religious observances[4][5].\n\n## Primary Age System: *Man Nenrei* (\u6e80\u5e74\u9f62)\n\nThe system used in virtually all aspects of modern Japanese life is *man nenrei*, which is identical to the Western or international method of age reckoning[7][2][5]. In this system, a person is zero years old at birth and ages one year on their birthday[8][3]. When Japanese people state their age in a contemporary context, it is calculated by *man nenrei*[9][10].\n\nTo express age, the Japanese language uses the counter *sai* (\u6b73 or the simplified \u624d), which is appended to the numeral, similar to \"years old\" in English[11][12][5][13]. Pronunciation for certain ages is irregular, most notably:\n*   **One year old**: *issai* (\u4e00\u6b73)[15][16]\n*   **Eight years old**: *hassai* (\u516b\u6b73)[15][16]\n*   **Ten years old**: *jussai* or *jissai* (\u5341\u6b73)[15][16]\n*   **Twenty years old**: *hatachi* (\u4e8c\u5341\u6b73), which does not use the *sai* counter[15][16][13].\n\n## Traditional Age System: *Kazoedoshi* (\u6570\u3048\u5e74)\n\nThe traditional system, *kazoedoshi* (literally \"counted years\"), operates on two fundamental principles[8][17]:\n1.  A baby is considered one year old at the moment of birth[8][9][18][4]. This is partly based on the idea that life begins in the womb, accounting for the period of gestation[18][1][19].\n2.  Everyone universally gains one year of age on New Year's Day (January 1st), not on their individual birthday[8][9][18][11][12].\n\nUnder this system, a baby born on December 31st would be one year old on the day of their birth and turn two years old the very next day, January 1st[8][19][2]. A person's *kazoedoshi* age is always one or two years older than their *man nenrei* age[18][20].\n*   **Before one's birthday in a given year**: *kazoedoshi* age = *man nenrei* age + 2[8][20].\n*   **On or after one's birthday in a given year**: *kazoedoshi* age = *man nenrei* age + 1[8][20].\n\nFor example, a person born in 1981 would be 44 years old in 2025 (after their birthday) by the *man nenrei* system, but 45 years old by the *kazoedoshi* system[21].\n\n### Legal Transition and Current Status\n\n*Kazoedoshi* was the standard method of age reckoning in Japan and other East Asian countries like China, Korea, and Vietnam for centuries[8][19]. The official transition to the Western system began during the Meiji Restoration[12][22].\n*   **1902**: Japan passed a law (\"Law No. 50\") officially adopting the *man nenrei* system[8][11][17].\n*   **1950**: Despite the 1902 law, *kazoedoshi* remained in common use[11][19]. In response, the government passed the \"Act on Counting of Ages\" (effective January 1, 1950) to further encourage and mandate the public to use the *man nenrei* system[5][11][17][1][23].\n\n### Contemporary Use of *Kazoedoshi*\n\nToday, the use of *kazoedoshi* is largely limited to traditional and religious contexts[4][5]. It is most prominently applied in:\n*   ***Yakudoshi*** **(\u5384\u5e74)**: The calculation of \"unlucky\" or \"calamitous\" years is typically based on the *kazoedoshi* count[24][25][26].\n*   ***Shichi-Go-San*** **(\u4e03\u4e94\u4e09)**: This festival celebrates girls aged three and seven and boys aged five. It is common to observe the rite based on the *kazoedoshi* system, though using the *man nenrei* age for convenience is a growing trend[27][19][13].\n*   ***Nenki*** **(\u5e74\u5fcc)**: Buddhist memorial services for the deceased are held according to the *kazoedoshi* count. For example, the third anniversary of a death is observed two years after the person passed away[19].\n\nThe system is also still used by some elderly people and in very rural areas[9][5].",

  "content": "**TRUE**.\n\nThe 2023 Winter Universiade, officially known as the Lake Placid 2023 FISU World University Games, was held in Lake Placid, New York, United States[1][2][3].\n\n## Host City Confirmation\n\nLake Placid was officially confirmed as the host for the 31st edition of the winter event on August 16, 2018[4][5]. The International University Sports Federation (FISU) completed the Host City Contract signing in Lausanne, Switzerland, after then-New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo signed an Executive Order authorizing Lake Placid and the surrounding North Country Region to host the games[6][4][7].\n\nLake Placid was the sole candidate for the event, and its bid was characterized by FISU President Oleg Matytsin as \"one of the strongest we have seen\"[6].\n\n## Event Details\n\nThe games took place from January 12 to January 22, 2023[1][8][9]. The competition featured 1,417 collegiate athletes between the ages of 17 and 25, representing 47 nations[10][9]. Initial projections anticipated more than 3,000 total participants, including student-athletes, delegates, and officials from 60 countries and 600 universities[4][5].\n\nWhile Lake Placid served as the main host city, events were also held in the neighboring communities of Wilmington, Saranac Lake, Potsdam, and North Creek[1]. Venues included the historic Herb Brooks Arena, site of the \"Miracle on Ice\" at the 1980 Olympics, which hosted the 2023 finals for ice hockey[4][11].\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThis marked the second time Lake Placid has hosted the Winter Universiade, having previously held the 7th edition of the games in 1972[6][4][12]. This made it the first city to host the Winter World University Games twice[13]. Lake Placid also has a significant Olympic history, having hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980[6][13]. The 2023 games were the first time the winter event was held in the United States in 51 years[12].",

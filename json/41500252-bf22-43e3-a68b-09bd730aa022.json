  "content": "FALSE. The available data indicates the opposite of the query's claim. United Nations reports from 2023 confirm that India's population grew and surpassed China's, making India the world's most populous country. China's population, in contrast, experienced a decline in 2023[1][2].\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nAnalysis of demographic data and United Nations reports shows that the query makes two factually incorrect assertions: that India's population decreased and that it fell behind China's in 2023. Evidence from multiple sources confirms that India's population continued to grow and that it officially overtook China as the world's most populous nation during that year[3][4][5].\n\n### Assertion 1: India's Population Decrease (Incorrect)\n\nIndia's population did not decrease in 2023; it continued to grow, albeit at a slowing rate compared to previous decades[6][7].\n\n*   **Population Growth Rate:** The population growth rate for India in 2023 was positive, with estimates ranging from 0.81% to 0.89%[6][8][9]. One source reported the 2023 growth rate at 0.88%, an increase from 0.79% in 2022[10][9].\n*   **Total Population Figures:** In absolute numbers, India's population increased from approximately 1.417 billion in 2022 to about 1.428 billion by mid-2023[11][12].\n*   **Fertility Rate:** While India's total fertility rate has declined to 2.0, which is below the replacement level of 2.1, the population continues to experience positive growth due to demographic momentum[13][14].\n\n### Assertion 2: India Falling Behind China (Incorrect)\n\nIn 2023, India surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation, marking the first time China has not held this position since the United Nations began keeping records in 1950[15][16].\n\n*   **UN Projections:** The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) projected that India's population would match and then surpass mainland China's in April 2023[3][17].\n*   **Mid-2023 Estimates:** The UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) \"State of World Population Report, 2023\" estimated India's population would reach 1.4286 billion (142.86 crore) by mid-2023, which was 2.9 million more than China's population of 1.4257 billion (142.57 crore)[18][5][19][12].\n*   **Uncertainty on Exact Date:** While the crossover happened in 2023, UN officials noted that due to data uncertainties, particularly the delay of India's 2021 census, it is not possible to pinpoint the exact date of the transition[5][20][21].\n\n## Divergent Demographic Trajectories\n\nThe shift in population rankings is due to opposing demographic trends in the two nations[17].\n\n*   **China's Population Decline:** China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that the country's population fell for the second consecutive year in 2023, decreasing by 2.08 million people to 1.40967 billion[1][22][2]. This decline is attributed to a record-low birth rate and an aging workforce[1][23]. China's population peaked in 2022 at 1.426 billion and has been falling since[24].\n*   **India's Continued Growth:** In contrast, India's population is projected to continue growing for several decades[24]. UN projections estimate India's population will peak around 1.7 billion in 2064[7]. India also has a significantly younger population, with a median age of 28 in 2023 and the world's largest youth cohort of 254 million people aged 15-24[7][25][26].",

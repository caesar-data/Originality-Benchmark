  "content": "TRUE. California widely employs grazing goats as an integral and increasingly popular component of its wildfire prevention and mitigation strategy[1][2][3]. This practice, known as targeted or prescribed grazing, is utilized by a broad spectrum of entities including state agencies, county and city governments, fire departments, public utilities, and private landowners to reduce flammable vegetation, especially in terrain that is difficult to access with machinery or human crews[4][6].\n\n## State and Federal Agency Involvement\n\nTargeted grazing is an official part of California's strategy to manage wildfire risk[1][4][7]. The practice is part of the state\u2019s \"Fuel Load Management Plan,\" which began in 2012 to reduce overgrown vegetation that fuels wildfires[8].\n\nState agencies and programs actively fund and implement goat grazing projects:\n*   **CAL FIRE (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection)** provides funding through its Wildfire Prevention Grants Program[9][10]. These grants have supported projects in numerous communities, including La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and Arcadia[9][11]. CAL FIRE has also funded a pilot program in Los Angeles County and awarded over $527,000 to UC Santa Cruz for goat grazing in steep areas[12][13].\n*   **Caltrans (California Department of Transportation)** has employed goats to create firebreaks along state highways, such as a 400-goat project along a two-mile stretch of Highway 101 in Sonoma County[14]. This was a collaborative effort involving state and local fire authorities[14].\n*   **California Department of Water Resources** uses goats to clear vegetation near critical infrastructure like Lake Oroville and water levees[8].\n*   **Federal Agencies**, including the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, have also used goats for fuel reduction projects in California, such as in the Cleveland National Forest and near Auburn[15][16]. The Los Angeles County Fire Department's Forestry Division has used grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for its grazing projects[17].\n\n## Widespread Adoption by Local Governments\n\nNumerous cities, counties, and fire districts across California have integrated goat grazing into their vegetation management and fire prevention plans.\n\n### County-Level Programs\n*   **Los Angeles County:** The LA County Fire Department uses goats and sheep for vegetation management, describing it as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method[18][19]. In one project, 300 goats were used to clear non-native grasses in East Malibu over two weeks[17][20].\n*   **Placer County:** In May 2024, the county deployed 2,000 goats to a park as part of 17 scheduled grazing operations on county-owned land[21][22].\n*   **Ventura County:** The Ventura County Fire Department has used goats for over a decade and budgets $935 per acre for grazing at sites including land near the Los Padres National Forest and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library[23]. A fire chief from the department called the animals \"the best fire prevention tools available\"[23].\n*   **Sacramento County:** The Department of Regional Parks includes sheep and goat grazing contracts in its annual Fire Fuel Reduction Action Plan to manage vegetation across thousands of acres of parkland[24][25].\n*   **Marin County:** The Sleepy Hollow Fire Protection District organized a large-scale project starting in 2018, which by 2019 had expanded to 1,200 goats grazing over 600 acres of high-risk woodlands[26][27].\n\n### Municipal and District Programs\n*   **Laguna Beach:** The city has one of the longest-running programs, using goats for fuel reduction since the early 1990s and expanding it after the major 1993 wildfire[28]. The program, managed by the fire department, maintains 276 acres of fuel breaks[28].\n*   **West Sacramento:** The city has contracted with goat herders since 2013, with herds clearing flammable brush twice a year[30]. The city's fire chief credited the goats with helping to save a housing complex during a 2022 fire by having previously reduced fuel loads in the area.\n*   **Glendale:** The Glendale Fire Department has used goats since 2018 to create a buffer zone between homes and open spaces in a city designated as a \"very high fire hazard\" zone.\n*   **East Bay Regional Park District:** This district uses thousands of goats, sheep, and cattle to graze across half of its 73 parks, maintaining critical fuel breaks[32]. The district spends $500,000 annually on grazing, which is significantly more cost-effective than the $1.2 million required for a 15-person hand crew[33].\n*   **Other Cities:** Numerous other cities\u2014including Anaheim, Oakland, Los Angeles, Arcadia, Elk Grove, San Clemente, Paso Robles, and Half Moon Bay\u2014contract for goat grazing services[8][34][35][36].\n\n## Use by Utilities and Other Organizations\n\nPublic utilities and other organizations use goats to protect critical infrastructure from wildfires.\n*   **San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E):** The utility's wildfire mitigation program, started in 2021, uses a stable of 600 goats to create firebreaks around electric transmission towers[37][38].\n*   **Southern California Edison (SoCal Edison):** Hires goat crews for vegetation management around power lines in rugged, mountainous terrain like the Shaver Lake area[39].\n*   **SoCalGas:** Collaborates with an environmental group to deploy goats to mitigate fire risks at its facilities[40].\n*   **Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART):** Employs a contractor with 700 goats to clear fire-prone vegetation from its right-of-way properties[41].\n*   **Educational Institutions:** School districts in Chino and San Francisco, as well as Mills College at Northeastern University and UC Merced, use goats for vegetation management[17][42][43][44].\n\n## Rationale and Cost-Effectiveness\n\nGoats are favored for several key reasons:\n*   **Accessibility:** They can graze on steep, rocky, and rugged terrain that is inaccessible or dangerous for human crews and heavy machinery[1]. A 400-goat herd can clear one to one-and-a-half acres per day[14].\n*   **Environmental Benefits:** Grazing is an eco-friendly alternative to chemical herbicides and fossil-fuel-powered machines[1][45]. The practice reduces soil erosion, improves water and air quality, controls invasive species, and regenerates soil with natural nutrients[22][30].\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** While costs vary, grazing is often cheaper than manual labor or machinery[6][19]. A U.S. Forest Service project found that goats cost $400-$500 per acre, compared to $1,200-$1,500 per acre for manpower. In Oceanside, landowners spend about $1,000 per acre for goat services[38].\n\nThe demand for grazing services has grown significantly in recent years, with some companies maintaining waiting lists for their herds[23][46].",

  "content": "FALSE. While German psychiatrist Hans Berger was the first to record brain waves in a human, which he accomplished in the 1920s, the first-ever recording of brain waves occurred nearly 50 years earlier in animal subjects.\n\n## Analysis of the Claim\n\nThe statement \"Brain waves were first recorded in the 1920s by Hans Berger\" is inaccurate because it omits the crucial qualifier of \"human\" brain waves. The initial discovery and recording of electrical activity in the brain predates Hans Berger's work significantly. The historical record credits Richard Caton with the first discovery in 1875 using animal subjects, whereas Berger's pioneering achievement was the successful application of this principle to humans in 1924[1][2].\n\n### Hans Berger and the First Human Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n\nHans Berger, a German psychiatrist, is correctly credited with inventing electroencephalography (EEG) and performing the first recording of electrical activity from a human brain[3][4][5]. This milestone event took place at the University Hospital of Jena, Germany[6][7].\n\n*   **Date of First Recording**: Berger himself retrospectively dated the first successful and reliable recording to July 6, 1924[7][6][8][9][10][11]. This places his work squarely within the 1920s, as the user's query suggests[12][13].\n*   **The Subject**: The first recording was performed on a 17-year-old boy who had undergone neurosurgery for a suspected brain tumor, leaving a defect in his skull that facilitated the process[6][7][9][14]. One source indicates the neurosurgeon was Nikolai Guleke[15].\n*   **Publication and Terminology**: Filled with self-doubt and a fear of criticism, Berger waited five years before publishing his findings[7][3][17]. His first paper, \"\u00dcber das Elektrenkephalogramm des Menschen\" (\"On the Electroencephalogram of Man\"), appeared in 1929[8][5]. Berger coined the term \"electroencephalogram\" and was the first to describe different brainwave patterns, such as the alpha and beta waves[3][18].\n\n### Richard Caton's Pioneering Discovery in Animals\n\nThe true \"first\" recording of brain waves was accomplished by Richard Caton, a British physician and scientist from Liverpool, in 1875[1][19][2][20].\n\n*   **Date and Publication**: Caton presented his findings on the electrical phenomena of the exposed cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys to the British Medical Association on August 4, 1875, and an abstract was published in the *British Medical Journal* that same year[21][22][23].\n*   **Methodology and Findings**: Using a sensitive galvanometer, Caton detected spontaneous electrical currents from the surface of the animals' brains[24][20]. He observed that these electrical currents fluctuated, increased during sleep, and ceased after death[2][22]. He also noted that sensory stimulation, such as light shone in an animal's eye, produced a negative variation in the electrical activity of specific brain areas[25][26].\n*   **Legacy**: Caton's work laid the foundation for Berger's later success[27]. Berger himself was aware of and cited Caton's experiments with animals[28][22]. It is now generally accepted that Caton's short note from 1875 contains the first description of the electroencephalogram[21].",

  "content": "**FALSE**\n\nThe statement that the 2023 Antarctic sea ice maximum reached a record-setting low of 16.96 million square kilometers is false because, while the 2023 maximum was a record low, the final, officially revised value is **17.07 million square kilometers**[1]. The 16.96 million square kilometer figure was a preliminary value based on near-real-time data that was later superseded[1].\n\n## Summary Assessment\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent in 2023 set an undisputed record for the lowest annual maximum in the 45-year satellite era, which began in 1979[2][3][4]. However, the specific value of 16.96 million square kilometers, while widely reported initially, was a preliminary figure[5][6]. Subsequent reprocessing with final, quality-controlled data by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) established the official record maximum at 17.07 million square kilometers, occurring on September 9, 2023[1].\n\n## Evolution of the 2023 Maximum Extent Value\n\nThe discrepancy in figures arises from the standard data processing methodology used by the NSIDC, which involves an initial near-real-time release followed by a final, reprocessed version[7][8].\n\n### Preliminary Data: 16.96 million km\u00b2\nInitial announcements from the NSIDC and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on September 25, 2023, stated that the Antarctic sea ice likely reached its maximum extent on September 10 at 16.96 million square kilometers (6.55 million square miles)[2][5]. This preliminary figure was based on near-real-time (NRT) satellite data, which allows for timely reporting but undergoes fewer quality control procedures[7]. This was the first time in the satellite record that the maximum extent had not surpassed 17 million square kilometers[3].\n\n### Final Revised Data: 17.07 million km\u00b2\nThe NSIDC's standard procedure involves reprocessing NRT data with a final, more thoroughly quality-controlled and gap-filled input data product from NASA Goddard, which can lag by a year or more[9]. On July 3, 2025, the NSIDC announced it had updated the Sea Ice Index, reprocessing the data for the period of January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024, from NRT to final data[10].\n\nThis reprocessing resulted in a revision of the 2023 maximum extent from 16.96 to **17.07 million square kilometers** (6.55 to 6.59 million square miles) and shifted the date of the maximum from September 10 to September 9[1].\n\n### Peer-Reviewed Analysis: 16.98 million km\u00b2\nA separate academic study published in *Geophysical Research Letters* by Jena et al. in March 2024 reported the 2023 Antarctic sea ice maximum at **16.98 million square kilometers**, occurring on September 7[11]. This analysis also utilized passive microwave satellite sensor data processed with the NASA Team algorithm but represents an independent calculation[11].\n\n## Confirmation of a Record-Low Event\n\nDespite the revision of the specific value, all analyses confirm that the 2023 maximum extent was the lowest on record by a substantial margin[2][4].\n\n*   **Comparison to Previous Record**: The preliminary 16.96 million km\u00b2 figure was 1.03 million square kilometers (398,000 square miles) below the previous record low set in 1986[3].\n*   **Comparison to Average**: The preliminary figure was 1.75 million square kilometers (676,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average Antarctic maximum extent[3]. The study by Jena et al. calculated the 16.98 million km\u00b2 maximum to be 1.46 million km\u00b2 below the long-term average[11].\n\nThe record-low status of 2023 is maintained even with the updated, final figures from the NSIDC, as shown in the ranking of the ten lowest Antarctic sea ice maximums on record[1].\n\n### Ten Lowest Antarctic Sea Ice Maximum Extents (1979-Present)\n| Rank | Year | Final Extent (millions of km\u00b2) | Date |\n|:----:|:----:|:------------------------------:|:------------:|\n| 1    | 2023 | 17.07                          | September 9  |\n| 2    | 2024 | 17.26                          | September 16 |\n| 3    | 2025 | 17.81                          | September 17 |\n| 4    | 1986 | 17.99                          | September 21 |\n| 5    | 2002 | 18.05                          | October 12   |\n| 6    | 2017 | 18.10                          | October 10   |\n| 7    | 1989 | 18.22                          | September 25 |\n| 8    | 2022 | 18.25                          | September 16 |\n| 9    | 2018 | 18.25                          | October 3    |\n| 10   | 2008 | 18.26                          | September 6  |\n*Source: National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)[1]*\n\nThe record-setting events of 2023 included both the summer minimum in February and the winter maximum in September, marking an unprecedented year for Antarctic sea ice loss[12][13].",

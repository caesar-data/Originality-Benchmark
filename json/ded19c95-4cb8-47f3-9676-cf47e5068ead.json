  "content": "TRUE: The statement that Croatia adopted the Euro as its currency on the 1st of January 2023 is factually correct[1][2][3].\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Croatia officially adopted the euro, replacing its former national currency, the kuna[4][5]. This action made Croatia the 20th member state of the eurozone[6][7][3]. The transition was the first enlargement of the euro area since Lithuania joined in 2015[3][8].\n\n## Official Confirmation and Timeline\n\nThe move was formally approved by the Council of the European Union on July 12, 2022, when it adopted the final legal acts required for Croatia's accession to the eurozone[6][9][10]. The Croatian government had previously stated its intention to adopt the euro on this date in November 2020 and adopted an action plan for the changeover in December 2020[6]. The strategic goal to adopt the euro at the earliest possible date was emphasized when Croatia entered the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) on July 10, 2020[11][12]. The Croatian authorities officially notified the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of the currency change on October 5, 2022[10].\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n*   **Conversion Rate**: The fixed conversion rate was set at \u20ac1 = 7.53450 Croatian kuna (kn)[6][2][5]. This rate was formally determined by the Council of the European Union on July 12, 2022[3].\n*   **Transition Period**: To facilitate the changeover, a dual circulation period was established where both the kuna and the euro could be used for payments during the first two weeks of January 2023, ending on January 14, 2023[13][5]. After this period, only the euro remained legal tender[5].\n*   **Price Display**: A dual display of prices in both kuna and euros began on September 5, 2022, to help citizens adapt to the new currency[5].\n*   **Exchanging Kuna**: The Croatian National Bank will continue to exchange kuna banknotes indefinitely, while kuna coins can be exchanged until December 31, 2025[2].\n\nOn the same day it joined the eurozone, Croatia was also accepted into the Schengen Area, which allows for passport-free travel between member countries[12][14][8].",

  "content": "TRUE: The statement is factual. Following Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022, Mastodon experienced a 488% increase in donations for the 2022 fiscal year and its monthly active users reached 1.8 million by the end of that year.\n\n## Verification of Claims\n\nThe assertion is composed of three interconnected claims: the timing of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, the subsequent growth in Mastodon's donations, and the increase in its active user base. Analysis of provided sources confirms all three elements are accurate.\n\n### Twitter Acquisition Timeline\n\nElon Musk's acquisition of Twitter was a prolonged process that began in April 2022 and, after a period of legal disputes, concluded in late October of the same year[1][2].\n\n*   **Initiation:** Musk made an offer to buy Twitter for approximately $44 billion on April 14, 2022[1][3]. The board accepted the deal on April 25, 2022[1][4].\n*   **Completion Date:** The deal was officially closed on October 27, 2022[1][5][6][7][8]. Musk took control as the new owner that day, tweeting \"the bird is freed\" and immediately firing several top executives[1][10][11]. The transaction was valued at $44 billion, or $54.20 per share[1][12][11].\n\n### Mastodon Donation Growth\n\nMastodon, a non-profit organization that relies on user donations, experienced a significant financial surge directly coinciding with the disruption at Twitter[13][14].\n\n*   **Donation Increase:** According to its 2022 annual report, Mastodon's donations grew by 488%[13][15][14].\n*   **Revenue Figures:** Total donations for fiscal year 2022 reached \u20ac325.9K (approximately $341,985), a substantial increase from the \u20ac55.6K received in fiscal year 2021[13][15][14].\n*   **Donor Growth:** The number of individual supporters grew from 560 at the end of 2021 to 9,603 in 2022, a 1,614% increase[13][14]. The number of Patreon donors alone increased sixfold from 1,428 in September 2022 to 7,962 in October 2022, the month Musk finalized the acquisition[15].\n\n### Mastodon Active User Growth\n\nMastodon's user base expanded dramatically in the final quarter of 2022 as users sought alternatives to Twitter[16][17].\n\n*   **Year-End User Count:** By the end of 2022, Mastodon had 1.8 million monthly active users[17][13]. This figure is also reported for the first week of January 2023, reflecting the user base at the close of the year[18][19]. This was a significant increase from the 294,000 monthly active users at the start of 2022[17][13].\n*   **Peak Activity:** User activity peaked higher before settling at the 1.8 million year-end figure. Between October and November 2022, monthly active users surged from approximately 300,000 to a high of 2.5 million[16][20]. This peak occurred in early December 2022[18][21][19].\n*   **Growth Correlation:** The growth was explicitly linked to Musk's takeover. Mastodon gained nearly half a million new users in the days immediately following the October 27 acquisition[22][23]. Daily app downloads rose from 3,400 on October 27 to 113,400 by November 6, 2022[18].",

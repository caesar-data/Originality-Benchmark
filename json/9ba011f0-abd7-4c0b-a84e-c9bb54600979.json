  "content": "TRUE.\n\nBased on the 2025 World Robotics report from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the ranking of the top industrial robot markets by annual installations in 2024 is factually correct as stated[1][2]. China is the largest market, followed by Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea[3].\n\n## Industrial Robot Installations by Country (2024)\n\nThe data for annual installations confirms the specified order of the world's largest industrial robot markets[1].\n\n| Rank | Country | Annual Installations (2024) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | China | 295,000 units[1][4] |\n| 2 | Japan | 44,500 units[1][5] |\n| 3 | United States | 34,200 units[1] |\n| 4 | Republic of Korea | 30,600 units[1] |\n\n### Market Leader: China\n\nChina is by far the world's largest market for industrial robots, with annual installations reaching a record high of 295,000 units in 2024[4][7]. This represents a 7% increase from 2023[8][9]. China's installations account for 54% of all global deployments, meaning more than one out of every two robots installed worldwide in 2024 went into a Chinese factory[1][8][10]. The country's total operational stock of industrial robots now stands at over 2 million units[3][12].\n\n### Other Leading Markets\n\n*   **Japan** maintained its position as the second-largest market, installing 44,500 units in 2024, a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year[1][5][13]. Japan's operational stock grew by 3% to 450,500 units[1][5].\n*   The **United States** ranks third, with 34,200 new installations in 2024[1]. This figure represents a 9% decline from the prior year[1].\n*   The **Republic of Korea** is the fourth-largest market, having installed 30,600 units in 2024, which was a 3% decrease[1].\n\nThese four countries, along with Germany (the world's fifth-largest market with 26,982 installations), collectively accounted for 78% of global industrial robot installations in 2024[2][1].",

  "content": "TRUE: Multiple independent studies and surveys consistently show that the percentage of U.S. workers who do not use all of their paid time off (PTO) is significantly higher than 40%, or 4 in 10.\n\n## Supporting Data on Unused Paid Time Off\n\nA wide range of research from various sources confirms that a substantial portion of the U.S. workforce leaves paid time off unused. The reported percentages vary by survey and year but consistently exceed the 40% threshold.\n\n*   **Pew Research Center:** A frequently cited 2023 Pew Research Center survey of 5,188 U.S. adults found that 46% of workers who receive paid time off take less than they are offered[1][2][3][4]. The same survey indicated that 48% use all of their available days off[5][6][7].\n*   **Sorbet Financial Technology:** A survey of 1,500 U.S. employees by Sorbet found that nearly two-thirds (62%) of Americans did not use all of their PTO in 2023, letting a third of it go to waste[8][9].\n*   **Harris Poll:** A Harris Poll survey revealed that 78% of Americans do not use the maximum amount of paid time off allowed by their employer[11]. Another Harris Poll from May 2024 found that three in four workers did not use their maximum permitted PTO[12].\n*   **U.S. Travel Association:** Research conducted by the U.S. Travel Association, Oxford Economics, and Ipsos found that 55% of American workers did not use all their allotted time off in 2018[13][14][15]. Similar studies from this group reported that 52% of workers left vacation time unused in 2017 and 54% did so in 2016[17][18][19].\n*   **Other Surveys:** Various other studies reinforce this trend:\n    *   A QuickBooks survey found that nearly 61% of those with available PTO left some unused, and another metric from the same source stated 70% of workers with PTO did not use it all[20].\n    *   A 2024 survey by Solitaired revealed that 47% of Americans left PTO unused[21].\n    *   A Zippia analysis for 2022 showed 55% of Americans did not use all their PTO[14][22].\n    *   An Expedia report found that 53% of Americans did not plan to use all their time off in a year[23].\n    *   An Eagle Hill Consulting survey noted that 48% of U.S. employees did not expect to take all their vacation days by year-end[24][25].\n\n## Stated Reasons for Not Using PTO\n\nWorkers cite a range of personal and professional pressures for not taking their full allotment of time off. According to the Pew Research Center survey, the most common reasons among those who don't use all their leave are:\n\n*   **No Perceived Need:** 52% state they don\u2019t feel they need to take more time off[1][4].\n*   **Fear of Falling Behind:** 49% worry about falling behind at work[1][2][3].\n*   **Guilt About Co-workers:** 43% feel bad about colleagues taking on additional work[1][2][4].\n*   **Career Concerns:** 19% believe taking more time off could hurt their chances for career advancement[4][26].\n*   **Fear of Job Loss:** 16% fear they might risk losing their job[2][4].\n*   **Discouragement from Management:** 12% say their boss discourages time off[2][4].\n\n## Scale and Economic Impact of Unused PTO\n\nThe collective amount of unused vacation time represents a significant figure in both days and monetary value.\n\n*   **Total Unused Days:** In 2018, American workers left a record 768 million vacation days unused, a 9% increase from 2017[13][14][27]. This was up from 705 million unused days in 2017 and 662 million in 2016[19][18].\n*   **Forfeited Days and Value:** Of the 768 million unused days in 2018, 236 million were completely forfeited, equating to $65.5 billion in lost benefits for workers[27][28]. Another estimate placed the value of unused vacation days at over $312 billion in one year[8][29]. The average personal loss per worker has been estimated at $604 to $1,800 in unused time[30][20].\n\n## Demographic and Employment-Level Variances\n\nThe tendency to leave PTO unused varies across different worker demographics, according to the Pew Research Center:\n\n*   **Income and Education:** Upper-income workers (51%) and those with a bachelor's degree or higher (51%) are more likely to take less time off than offered compared to their middle- and lower-income counterparts (45% and 41%, respectively) or those with less education (41%)[1][5].\n*   **Job Role:** Salaried workers (52%) are more likely than hourly workers (39%) to leave time unused[1]. Similarly, managers (54%) are more likely to do so than non-managers (42%)[1].\n*   **Industry:** The practice is especially prevalent in education (68% leave time unused) and government/public administration/military (57%)[1].",

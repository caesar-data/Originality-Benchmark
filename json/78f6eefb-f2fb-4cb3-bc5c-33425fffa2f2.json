  "content": "TRUE. Scientific evidence from psychological, physiological, and neurobiological studies substantiates the claim that hunger increases negative emotions and decreases positive emotions.\n\nA substantial body of research demonstrates that the physiological state of hunger is strongly associated with increased negative affect, such as anger and irritability, and a concurrent reduction in positive affect, such as pleasure and vigor[1][2]. This phenomenon, colloquially known as being \"hangry,\" is supported by studies conducted in both naturalistic, everyday settings and controlled laboratory experiments[3][4]. The underlying mechanisms involve the brain's response to low glucose levels, the release of stress hormones, and the activation of specific neural circuits that create an unpleasant drive state to motivate food-seeking behavior[5][6].\n\n## Hunger's Impact on Negative Emotions\n\nMultiple studies confirm a direct and significant link between being hungry and experiencing negative emotional states. Evidence from field studies, experimental research, and analyses of related conditions like food insecurity converge on this conclusion.\n\n### Correlational and Experimental Findings\n\nA landmark study published in *PLOS ONE* was the first to investigate the \"hangry\" phenomenon outside of a laboratory[3][1]. Researchers tracked 64 adults in Central Europe for 21 days, prompting them to report their hunger levels and emotional states five times a day through a smartphone app[3][4]. The results were substantial:\n*   **Anger and Irritability**: Greater levels of self-reported hunger were strongly associated with more intense feelings of anger and irritability[4][7].\n*   **Quantitative Impact**: Hunger accounted for 37% of the variance in participants' irritability and 34% of the variance in anger[1][3][8]. Another analysis within the primary study noted that hunger could explain as much as 56% of the variance in irritability and 48% in anger[4].\n*   **Robustness**: This association remained significant even after controlling for demographic factors such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), dietary habits, and individual personality traits[1][9].\n*   **Duration of Hunger**: Both day-to-day fluctuations in hunger and residual hunger levels averaged over the three-week period were found to cause negative emotions[3][8].\n\nThis correlational evidence is supported by experimental studies that establish a causal link. A study that randomly assigned healthy-weight women to either a 14-hour fast (hunger condition) or a satiated state found that the hungry women reported significantly higher levels of tension, anger, fatigue, and confusion[2]. Similarly, studies on married couples found that lower blood glucose levels were associated with increased aggression toward a partner[10][11].\n\n### Evidence From Hunger-Related Conditions\n\nResearch into states of chronic or severe hunger further reinforces the connection between food deprivation and negative affect.\n*   **Food Insecurity**: A systematic review of literature shows a significant positive association between food insecurity and multiple indicators of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress[12]. This link holds across various populations, such as adults, college students, parents, and those with chronic diseases, and in numerous countries[12]. One study found that daily caregiver hunger was a direct mediator of parent-child conflict through its effect on negative affect[13].\n*   **Therapeutic and Historical Starvation**: The Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment documented that severe food restriction produced a psychological syndrome characterized by restlessness, irritability, and poor impulse control, with some participants reporting violent and angry impulses[14]. Historical diaries from the Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghettos during World War II also record how hunger led to increased irritability, bickering, and fighting among inhabitants[15].\n\n## Hunger's Impact on Positive Emotions\n\nThe research also confirms that hunger diminishes positive emotional states, though some findings have required careful interpretation regarding the difference between positive valence and high arousal.\n\n### Direct Evidence of Decreased Positive Affect\n\nStudies that directly measure feelings of pleasure, vigor, and well-being consistently find that hunger has a negative effect.\n*   The \"Hangry in the field\" study found that higher levels of hunger were associated with lower ratings of pleasure[4][16]. Hunger accounted for 38% of the variance in pleasure ratings recorded by participants[3].\n*   The experimental study involving a 14-hour fast demonstrated that hungry women reported lower positive emotions, specifically \"lower vigour and marginally lower esteem-related affect,\" compared to their satiated counterparts[2][18]. A separate study by Jonker et al. replicated this finding, showing that hungry women reported less vigor[19].\n\n### Resolving Arousal vs. Positive Valence\n\nAn apparent contradiction emerged from a large-scale study which found that greater hunger intensity was prospectively associated with *increasing* feelings of being \"active\" and \"lively\"[20]. However, neurobiological and psychological research clarifies that these high-arousal states are not synonymous with positive emotions but rather represent a negatively-valenced drive state.\n*   **Arousal vs. Valence**: Emotion is understood along two primary dimensions: valence (pleasant to unpleasant) and arousal (high to low energy)[21][22]. A state can be high-arousal and negative (e.g., anger, panic) or high-arousal and positive (e.g., excitement)[22].\n*   **Foraging Behavior**: Hunger is known to produce a behavioral phenotype characterized by increased hyperactivity, restlessness, and excitability[14]. This increase in locomotor activity is an evolutionarily conserved foraging response to facilitate food-seeking[14][23].\n*   **Neurobiological Driver**: This foraging drive is initiated by specific \"hunger neurons\" in the hypothalamus known as AgRP neurons[6]. While the activation of these neurons promotes activity, food-seeking, and exploration, it simultaneously generates an unpleasant, negative internal state[6][24]. One researcher described this as a \"bad feeling\" that eating serves to alleviate[24].\n\nTherefore, the feelings of being \"active\" and \"lively\" associated with hunger likely reflect a negatively-valenced, high-arousal state of restlessness geared toward survival, rather than a positively-valenced emotion like happiness or excitement. This resolves the apparent conflict in the literature.\n\n## Physiological Mechanisms of Hunger-Induced Emotional Changes\n\nThe link between hunger and mood is rooted in well-defined physiological and neurobiological processes.\n\n*   **Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia)**: The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy[25][26]. A drop in blood glucose, a primary signal of hunger, can disrupt brain activity, leading to emotional instability and cognitive impairment[26][27].\n*   **Stress Hormone Release**: Low blood sugar triggers the release of stress hormones, including adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol[28][29]. These hormones are part of the body's 'fight-or-flight' response and can directly cause feelings of irritability, anxiety, and nervousness[28][30]. Animal studies confirm that induced hypoglycemia increases blood corticosterone (an indicator of stress) and leads to behaviors expressive of stress and anxiety[31][32].\n*   **Depleted Self-Control Resources**: Self-control and emotional regulation are energetically demanding processes that rely on glucose[5]. Low glucose levels can leave an individual with insufficient energy to override irritable feelings and aggressive impulses, a concept linked to the theory of ego depletion[5][9].\n*   **Neurotransmitter Disruption**: Glucose imbalances can also disrupt the function of key neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are critical for mood regulation[26][29].",

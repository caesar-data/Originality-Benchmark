  "content": "FALSE. The statement that Drs. Stephanie Murphy and John Hoffman won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023 for work on blood clotting mechanisms is incorrect. The prize was awarded to two other individuals for their foundational research on mRNA vaccines.\n\n## 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates\n\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was jointly awarded to **Katalin Karik\u00f3** and **Drew Weissman**[1][2][3]. The prize was divided equally between them, with each receiving a 1/2 share[1].\n\n*   **Katalin Karik\u00f3, PhD**, is affiliated with Szeged University in Hungary and is an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania[3][4]. Born in Szolnok, Hungary, in 1955, she is the 13th woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine[5][3].\n*   **Drew Weissman, MD, PhD**, is the Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and serves as the director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovations[5][3]. He was born in Massachusetts, USA, in 1959[3].\n\nThe announcement was made by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, on October 2, 2023[6][7]. The prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a cash reward of 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately $1 million USD), which was shared equally between the two laureates[8][3].\n\n## Awarded Research: mRNA Vaccine Technology\n\nThe prize was not awarded for work on blood clotting mechanisms. Instead, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman were recognized \"for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19\"[9][6][10].\n\n### Key Scientific Contributions\n*   **Overcoming Inflammatory Response**: A major hurdle in using messenger RNA (mRNA) for therapeutic purposes was that it triggered a strong and unwanted inflammatory reaction from the immune system[11][12]. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman discovered that chemically modifying the nucleoside bases in the mRNA\u2014specifically, replacing uridine with pseudouridine\u2014rendered the mRNA non-immunogenic, almost completely abolishing the inflammatory response[13][9][7]. This seminal finding was published in 2005[14][13].\n*   **Increased Protein Production**: In subsequent studies, they demonstrated that mRNA with modified bases also led to a marked increase in protein production compared to unmodified mRNA[9][15].\n\nThese breakthroughs eliminated critical obstacles, fundamentally changing the scientific understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system[4]. Their work was pivotal for the unprecedented speed at which effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, were developed during the pandemic[4][17][12].",

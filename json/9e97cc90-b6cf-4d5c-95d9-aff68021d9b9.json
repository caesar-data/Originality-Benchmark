  "content": "TRUE. The claim that 25 women were serving in the U.S. Senate at the start of the 118th Congress in 2023 is factual, according to analysis of data from multiple research institutions and government sources.\n\n## Senate Composition at the Start of the 118th Congress\n\nAt the beginning of the 118th Congress in January 2023, 25 women held seats in the U.S. Senate, constituting 25% of the 100-member chamber[1][2]. This number tied the record set in the 116th Congress[3] and was just shy of the 26 women sworn in on the first day of the 117th Congress[4].\n\n### Party Affiliation and Demographics\n\nThe political and demographic breakdown of the 25 women senators at the start of the 118th Congress was as follows:\n*   **Party Breakdown:** Sources vary slightly on the exact party count, reflecting Senator Kyrsten Sinema's status as an Independent who caucused with Democrats. One count identified 16 Democrats and 9 Republicans[5][4]. Another breakdown specified 15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent[2]. The nine Republican women senators matched the previous record for the party[7].\n*   **Racial and Ethnic Composition:** Of the 25 women, 22 were White, two were Asian American, and one was Hispanic[4]. No Black, American Indian, or Alaska Native women were serving in the Senate at that time[4][8].\n\n## Analysis of Conflicting Data\n\nWhile the consensus figure is 25, several reports from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) state there were 24 women in the Senate during the 118th Congress[9][10][11][12].\n\nThis discrepancy is attributable to changes in Senate membership during the congressional term[13]. The initial count of 25 included Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who served from the start of the Congress until her death in September 2023[14][13]. Reports published after this date but before her successor was sworn in would reflect a total of 24 women senators. The CRS report breakdown of 14 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent totals 24, indicating a count taken after the composition had changed from the start of the session[10].\n\n## Historical and Subsequent Context\n\nThe 118th Congress's initial total of 25 female senators was part of a broader trend of increasing female representation, though it did not set a new record for the chamber[5].\n*   **117th Congress (2021-2023):** Began with a record 26 women sworn in, though the number serving for the majority of the session was 24[4][15].\n*   **119th Congress (2025-2027):** The subsequent Congress began with 26 women serving in the Senate (16 Democrats, 10 Republicans)[16][17][18].\n\nOverall, women comprised 28% of the total membership of the 118th Congress (both House and Senate), a record high at the time[1]. The total number of women in the 118th Congress was 149 or 153 depending on whether non-voting delegates are included[16][3].",

  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe claim that more than 1300 varieties of potato are grown in the Andes Mountains is factually correct. The provided research indicates the number is substantially higher, with a strong consensus among multiple sources, including the International Potato Center (CIP), placing the figure at 4,000 or more native varieties.\n\n## Quantitative Evidence for Andean Potato Diversity\n\nEstimates for the total number of potato varieties originating and cultivated in the Andean region consistently exceed 1,300, with most figures ranging from 3,000 to over 5,000.\n\n*   **General Estimates**: Numerous sources state there are over 4,000 edible and native potato varieties, with the majority found in the Andes[1][2][3]. These varieties were developed over centuries in the Andean highlands of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador at altitudes between 3,500 and 4,200 meters[1][4][5]. Some estimates place the number of native potato landraces cultivated in the Andes at approximately 4,000[6][7][8][9]. The lowest figure cited is still well above the claim, stating there are at least 2,000 varieties of Andean potatoes[10].\n\n*   **Higher-Range Estimates**: Several sources suggest even greater diversity. The International Potato Center (CIP) has noted that the Andean region is home to more than 4,500 potato landraces[11][12]. Other sources cite more than 4,800 edible varieties worldwide, with the highest concentration in the Andes[13]. Globally, there are around 5,000 potato varieties, with 3,000 of them located in the Andes alone[14][15].\n\n*   **Country-Specific Data (Peru)**: Peru, as a center of origin for the potato, exemplifies this diversity. Sources report that Peru alone is home to more than 3,000[16], over 3,500[17], over 4,000[18][19][20][21], and even more than 5,000 varieties[22]. The National Institute of Agricultural Innovation (INIA) in Peru has registered 6,408 varieties of native potatoes[17].\n\n### Data from the International Potato Center (CIP) Genebank\n\nThe International Potato Center (CIP), headquartered in Peru, is the primary repository for potato genetic resources and provides specific figures on its collection, which consists mainly of Andean varieties.\n\n*   **Total Accessions**: As of February 2021, the CIP genebank held 7,466 cultivated and wild potato accessions[6][7]. Of these, 4,870 are cultivated[6][7]. Another report specifies the active cultivated potato collection totals 5,205 accessions, which includes 4,797 traditional landrace cultivars from 18 countries, primarily in the Andean region[23].\n\n*   **Landrace Holdings**: The number of active landraces in the CIP collection is 4,467[6][7]. The CIP's cryobank holds 4,086 accessions, of which 3,757 (92%) are landraces collected from Andean countries[24][25]. Peru is the origin for 61% of these cryopreserved landraces, followed by Bolivia (11%), Ecuador (8%), and Colombia (6%)[24][25].",

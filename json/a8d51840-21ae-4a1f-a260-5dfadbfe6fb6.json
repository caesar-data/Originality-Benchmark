  "content": "FALSE: The provided research contains no credible evidence to support the claim that tech entrepreneur Emily White has spent more than $2 million developing a sleep-enhancement system. The assertion appears to be a conflation of information regarding multiple individuals named Emily White, her unrelated business ventures, and funding announcements for different companies.\n\n## Analysis of the Claim\n\nAn investigation into the provided sources reveals several distinct points that invalidate the query. The prominent tech executive Emily White is not associated with a sleep technology company, and the financial figures mentioned are linked to unreliable sources or unrelated businesses.\n\n### The Identity of Tech Entrepreneur Emily White\n\nThe most prominent \"tech entrepreneur\" named Emily White identified in the research has an extensive career at major technology firms [1].\n*   **Career History**: She has held executive positions at Google, Facebook, Instagram, and was the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Snapchat [1][2].\n*   **Current Role**: She is the president of Anthos Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm based in Los Angeles [1][3].\n*   **Other Individuals**: The research identifies other professionals named Emily White who are not this tech executive, including a founding partner at Collective Entertainment [4], an author [5], and an intern at NPR [6].\n\n### Emily White's Known Entrepreneurial Venture: Mave\n\nIn 2016, the tech executive Emily White founded a startup named Mave [7][8].\n*   **Business Model**: Mave was not a sleep-enhancement company. It was a high-end personal concierge startup, described as a \"chief of staff for your household\" [7][9]. The service utilized virtual personal assistants, machine learning, and category experts to manage household tasks [7].\n*   **Funding**: No funding amount for Emily White's Mave is mentioned in the provided research.\n\n### Deconstruction of \"Sleep-Enhancement System\" Claims\n\nTwo sources link an \"Emily White\" to a \"sleep-enhancement system,\" but both lack credibility as factual news reports.\n*   **`teachtogether.tech`**: This website mentions an \"Emily White\" securing a \"$50,000 seed investment\" for a \"sleep-enhancement system\" [10]. However, further research reveals that `teachtogether.tech` is an educational book and resource for teaching technology, not a news outlet [11][12]. The reference is likely a hypothetical case study for educational purposes.\n*   **`lesswrong.com`**: A post on this community blog mentions a \"$45 Million\" investment commitment for \"Emily White\u2019s new sleep-enhancement system\" [13]. This is a significant claim with no corroboration from any financial news sources within the research, making its veracity highly doubtful.\n\n### The \"$2 Million\" Figure and Unrelated Companies\n\nThe research does not connect Emily White to a $2 million investment in sleep technology. The figure likely originates from a separate company that coincidentally shares a name with her startup.\n*   **Mave (Real Estate AI)**: In October 2024, a Toronto-based AI startup for real estate agents, also named Mave, announced it had raised CAD$2 million (approximately $1.45 million USD) in pre-seed funding [14][15][16]. This company was founded by Raz Zohar and is entirely unrelated to Emily White or her 2016 concierge startup [15][16].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe assertion that tech entrepreneur Emily White spent over $2 million on a sleep-enhancement system is unsupported by the evidence. The claim merges the identity of a known tech executive with unsubstantiated information from non-journalistic sources and the funding details of an unrelated company. Her actual startup, Mave, was a personal concierge service, not a sleep technology venture.",

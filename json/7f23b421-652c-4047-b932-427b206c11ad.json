  "content": "FALSE.\n\nThe statement that Ava DuVernay's \"A Wrinkle in Time\" had the biggest debut for a film directed by a woman with a $280 million opening weekend is factually incorrect on both claims. The film's opening weekend gross was significantly lower than stated, and it did not set the box office record for a female-directed film.\n\n## Box Office Performance of \"A Wrinkle in Time\" (2018)\n\nThe claim of a $280 million opening weekend is a substantial overstatement of the film's actual earnings.\n\n*   **Domestic Opening Weekend**: *A Wrinkle in Time* earned approximately $33.1 million in the U.S. and Canada during its opening weekend of March 9-11, 2018[1][2]. The precise total was $33,123,609[3][4]. It debuted in second place at the box office, behind Disney's *Black Panther*[5][6].\n*   **Worldwide Opening Weekend**: The film's international debut in six initial markets grossed $6.3 million[7][8]. This brought its total global opening weekend gross to approximately $39.6 million[8].\n\n## Record for a Female-Directed Film Debut\n\n*A Wrinkle in Time* did not set a record for the largest opening weekend for a film directed by a woman, either at the time of its release or since.\n\n*   **Record at the Time of Release (March 2018)**: When *A Wrinkle in Time* debuted, the record for the biggest domestic opening for a film solely directed by a woman was held by Patty Jenkins' *Wonder Woman* (2017), which had opened to over $100 million[9][10]. The ~$33 million opening of *A Wrinkle in Time* was not close to this record.\n*   **Current Record Holder (Domestic)**: The record for the highest-grossing domestic opening weekend for a female director is held by Greta Gerwig's *Barbie* (2023), which earned $162,022,044[11][12][13].\n*   **Previous Record Holders**: Before *Barbie*, the record for a film with a female director was held by *Captain Marvel* (2019), co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, which opened to $153.4 million domestically[11][14]. *Captain Marvel* also set the record for the biggest worldwide opening for a female-fronted film at the time, with a global debut of approximately $455 million[15][16].",

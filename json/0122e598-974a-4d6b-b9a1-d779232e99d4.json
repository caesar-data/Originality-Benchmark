  "content": "FALSE. The available evidence indicates that Olivia Wilde was not conceived through surrogacy. Her biological mother is Leslie Cockburn, who was pregnant with Wilde while working as a journalist in hazardous situations.\n\n## Evidence of Leslie Cockburn's Pregnancy\n\nMultiple sources recount statements from Olivia Wilde describing her mother, Leslie Cockburn, as a \"strong badass pregnant lady\" who set a high standard for her own pregnancy[1][2]. Wilde has been inspired by her mother, a TV documentary maker who traveled to war zones while pregnant with Olivia and her siblings[3][2].\n\nSpecific anecdotes shared by Wilde and reported in biographical articles directly contradict the surrogacy claim:\n*   Wilde has shared a story her mother tells about being eight months pregnant with her on a plane in the Middle East that had a bomb on board[1][4][5].\n*   While pregnant herself, Wilde recalled this history, stating, \"When I'm worrying about, 'Am I allowed to get on the treadmill?' My mom's like, 'I was in warzones with you guys!'\"[3][2].\n\n## Biographical Information\n\nBiographical sources consistently identify Olivia Wilde's parents as journalists Leslie Cockburn and Andrew Cockburn[6][4][7].\n*   **Birth Name:** Olivia Jane Cockburn[6][8][9]. She later adopted the pen name Wilde[10].\n*   **Date and Place of Birth:** She was born on March 10, 1984, in New York City[11][9][12].\n*   **Mother's Identity:** Her mother is Leslie Cockburn (n\u00e9e Leslie Corkill Redlich), an American-born journalist, producer for *60 Minutes*, and documentary filmmaker[9][13][14][11][15]. Leslie was born on September 2, 1952, in San Mateo, California[4][16].\n*   **Family:** Leslie and Andrew Cockburn married in 1977 and have three children: Chloe Frances Cockburn (born 1979), Olivia Wilde (born 1984), and Charles Philip Cockburn (born 1993)[4][17].\n\nA search for the origins of a rumor that Olivia Wilde was conceived via surrogacy did not yield any results, suggesting the claim is unsubstantiated[18][19]. The available information focuses on recent, unrelated pregnancy speculation and other public controversies[20][21][22].",

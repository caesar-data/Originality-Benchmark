  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe assertion that Apple sold 82 million AirPods and 53 million Apple Watches in 2022 is consistent with figures published in multiple market analyses and industry reports. While estimates for AirPods unit sales vary across different research firms, the 82 million figure is a widely cited statistic. The 53 million unit sales figure for the Apple Watch is a reasonable rounding of the 53.9 million units reported by several sources.\n\n## AirPods Sales Analysis (2022)\n\nMultiple sources report that Apple sold 82 million AirPods units in 2022[1][2][3]. For context, this followed sales of 85 million in 2021 and a peak of 114 million in 2020[1][2][3]. The revenue generated from AirPods in 2022 is estimated at $14.5 billion[4][5][6].\n\n### Competing Analyst Estimates\nIt is important to note that analyst estimates for AirPods shipments in 2022 vary.\n*   **Counterpoint Research** reported a lower figure, stating that Apple AirPods shipments reached 71 million units for the calendar year 2022[7].\n*   **Canalys** reported that Apple's total True Wireless Stereo (TWS) shipments for 2022, a category that includes both AirPods and Beats by Dre products, amounted to 91.4 million units[8][9]. This was a slight decrease of 1% from 2021 shipments[9].\n\n### Quarterly TWS Shipments (AirPods & Beats)\nThe 91.4 million total TWS shipments figure from Canalys for 2022 is broken down by quarter as follows[8]:\n*   **Q1 2022:** 21.7 million units, of which 19.3 million were AirPods and 2.4 million were Beats[8][10].\n*   **Q2 2022:** 17.5 million units, of which 15.3 million were AirPods and 2.2 million were Beats[8].\n*   **Q3 2022:** 23.8 million units[8][11]. The newly released AirPods Pro 2 accounted for 4.2 million units, or 20% of all AirPods shipments during this quarter[12][11][13].\n*   **Q4 2022:** 28.4 million units[8][14]. The AirPods Pro 2 was a major driver, accounting for 63% of all AirPods shipments in the final quarter[8][15].\n\n## Apple Watch Sales Analysis (2022)\n\nThe claim that Apple sold approximately 53 million Apple Watches in 2022 is strongly supported by market data. Multiple reports place the figure at **53.9 million units** for the year, marking the first time annual sales surpassed the 50 million mark[16][17]. This represented a 17% increase in shipments compared to 2021[17][19].\n\n### Market Dominance\nIn 2022, Apple's strong sales performance solidified its leadership in the smartwatch market.\n*   **Market Share:** Apple accounted for 34.1% of all smartwatch shipments globally[16][17][19]. Quarterly market share fluctuated, with Apple capturing 32% in Q1, 27% in Q2, 22% in Q3, and 37% in Q4 2022[20][21].\n*   **Revenue Share:** The company's dominance was even more pronounced in terms of revenue, capturing 60% of the entire market's revenue for the year[16][17][19].\n*   **User Base:** As of December 2022, an estimated 115 million people were using an Apple Watch[22].\n\nWhile most sources converge around the 53.9 million figure, one report cited a lower estimate of 41.4 million units sold in 2022[23]. However, the broader consensus supports the higher sales number.",

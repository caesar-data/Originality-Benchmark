  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe claim that Gianluca Vialli passed away in January 2023 is factual[1][2][3][4]. Born on July 9, 1964, in Cremona, Italy, Vialli died at the age of 58 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer[2][5][6]. His death occurred in London, England, at the Royal Marsden Hospital[2][1][7].\n\nThere is a minor variation in the specific date of death reported across sources, though all confirm the month and year.\n*   **January 5, 2023**: Some sources list the date of death as January 5, 2023[2][1].\n*   **January 6, 2023**: The majority of news outlets and databases report the date as January 6, 2023, which is when his death was widely announced[7][9][3][4][10][11][12][13][14][15].\n*   **Overnight Between Jan 5-6**: Several sources reconcile this by stating he died on the night between Thursday, January 5, and Friday, January 6, 2023[2][1][16].\n\nVialli was a former Italian international striker and manager, renowned for his career at clubs including Sampdoria, Juventus, and Chelsea[17][11]. He played 59 times for the Italy national team[10][12]. His death prompted tributes across the football world, and the Italian Football Federation announced a minute's silence before matches to honor his life[5].",

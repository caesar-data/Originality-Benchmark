  "content": "TRUE.\n\nThe assertion that cabbages can achieve a diameter of four feet or more is factual, supported by documentation of specific giant vegetable varieties and world-record specimens, particularly those grown in Alaska[1][2][3].\n\n### Dimensions of Giant Cabbage Varieties and Specimens\n\n*   **Specific Cultivars**: The O-S Cross Hybrid cabbage variety, an All-America Selections Winner from 1951, is known to produce heads that are 3-4 feet across when grown under the unique conditions of an Alaskan summer[2].\n*   **World Record Dimensions**: The world's heaviest cabbage, grown by Scott Robb in Palmer, Alaska, weighed 138.25 pounds (62.71 kg) in 2012[4][3]. The overall size of this cabbage, measured from the tip of one outside leaf to the other, was seven feet, three inches[3].\n*   **Other Documented Giants**: Other exceptionally large specimens have been documented with similar dimensions. One farmer in Salcha, Alaska, cultivated a cabbage measuring 6'9\" wide[6]. Another farmer claimed to have a cabbage that was nearly seven feet across[1]. Even earlier, a giant cabbage grown by Steve Hubacek had leaves that spanned about five feet, though its head measured a smaller 21 inches across[7].\n\n### Contributing Factors\nThe growth of such enormous vegetables in Alaska is largely attributed to the region's unique environmental conditions[1]. The long summer days, with over 23 hours of sunlight, combined with colder soil, create ideal growing conditions that allow these cabbage varieties to reach sizes far exceeding the average[1][8]. While a large cabbage in the lower 48 states might weigh around 15 pounds, it is not uncommon for Alaskan cabbages to exceed 100 pounds[1][9].",

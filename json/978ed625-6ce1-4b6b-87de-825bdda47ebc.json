  "content": "TRUE. The claim that filmmaker Werner Herzog walked from Munich to Paris to see a dying friend is factually correct in all its essential components, supported by Herzog's own published diaries and numerous secondary sources[1][2][3].\n\n## An Act of Faith: The 1974 Pilgrimage\n\nIn late November 1974, German filmmaker Werner Herzog received a phone call from a friend in Paris with the news that his close friend, mentor, and film historian Lotte H. Eisner was gravely ill and likely dying[1][4][5]. Herzog's immediate response was to undertake a journey on foot from his home in Munich to Eisner's bedside in Paris[1][6]. This act was not merely a visit but a pilgrimage rooted in the conviction that the physical ordeal would prevent her death[7][8].\n\nIn the foreword to his diary of the journey, Herzog wrote, \"I set off on the most direct route to Paris, in full faith, believing that she would stay alive if I came on foot\"[1][9]. He expressed this belief with characteristic intensity at the start of his trek: \"Our Eisner mustn\u2019t die, she will not die, I won\u2019t permit it... When I\u2019m in Paris she will be alive. She must not die. Later, perhaps, when we allow it\"[1][10]. He viewed the walk as casting a lifeline between them that would not be severed as long as he kept moving[6].\n\n### Lotte Eisner's Significance\n\nLotte Eisner was a pivotal figure for Herzog and the New German Cinema movement[6]. A German-Jewish film critic and historian who had fled the Nazis, she was seen as the \"consciousness\" of the new generation of filmmakers, providing a bridge to the German Expressionist cinema of the 1920s and lending legitimacy to their work after the cultural void of the Third Reich[6][11]. Herzog considered his generation to be \"orphans\" and credited Eisner's authority with opening the gates for them to reach international audiences[6]. He stated, \"German cinema could not do without her now, we would not permit her death\"[1][12].\n\n## Journey Details and Documentation\n\nHerzog's pilgrimage began on Saturday, November 23, 1974, and concluded upon his arrival in Paris on December 14, 1974, lasting approximately three weeks[4][13]. The distance of the trek is cited as being between 500 and 600 miles[2][3][9].\n\n### The Ordeal\n\nHe set out with only a jacket, a compass, and a duffel bag containing the \"barest essentials\"[1][4]. The journey took him through the \"deep chill and snowstorms of winter\"[4][14]. His diary details the physical suffering he endured, including blisters from new boots, aching tendons, and constant exposure to harsh weather[15]. To find shelter, he often broke into vacant holiday homes and barns[15][3]. His sustenance was meager, often consisting of just milk and tangerines[16][17].\n\n### *Of Walking in Ice*\n\nHerzog documented his experiences and inner state in a small notebook he carried[1][18]. These writings, which he stated were not originally intended for readers, were published in German in 1978 as *Vom Gehen im Eis*[4][19]. The English translation, *Of Walking in Ice*, followed in 1980[20]. The diary is described as a blend of poetic descriptions of the frozen landscape, documentation of physical hardship, and hallucinatory or dreamlike reflections on loneliness, memory, and existence[3][21].\n\n## Outcome and Aftermath\n\nUpon arriving in Paris on December 14, Herzog went to see Eisner[6]. He found her alive, though still tired and marked by her illness[9][18]. In his final diary entry, he describes the moment: \"She looked at me and smiled very delicately, and since she knew that I was someone on foot and therefore unprotected, she understood me\"[9][19]. He told her, \"open the window, from these last days onward I can fly\"[9][22].\n\nLotte Eisner recovered from her illness and lived for another nine years, passing away in 1983[4][23]. Herzog later recounted that eight years after his walk, Eisner summoned him back to Paris, telling him, \"there's still this spell on me I must die\"[18]. Herzog replied, \"Lotte, it's lifted off now,\" and she died eight days later[18].",

  "content": "TRUE. Cats possess the genetic and molecular framework required to taste umami, a savory flavor profile. However, the mechanism of their umami receptors differs significantly from that of humans, leading to distinct taste preferences, particularly a strong attraction to foods like tuna that are rich in specific combinations of nucleotides and amino acids.\n\n## Genetic and Molecular Basis of Feline Umami Perception\n\nIn mammals, the perception of umami taste is mediated by a heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) formed by the assembly of two protein subunits: T1R1 and T1R3[2]. These proteins are encoded by the genes `TAS1R1` and `TAS1R3`, respectively[3].\n\nScientific research has definitively confirmed that cats possess both of these crucial genes in a functional form[5][2]. Early studies established that the `Tas1r3` gene is functional and expressed in feline taste buds[6][7]. Since the `Tas1r3` subunit is also required for sweet taste (in a dimer with T1R2), and cats are known to be indifferent to sweets due to a non-functional `Tas1r2` gene (a pseudogene), the functionality of `Tas1r3` pointed toward its role in umami perception[7][8]. More recent work, involving the genetic sequencing of a cat's biopsied tongue tissue, provided the first direct evidence that the `Tas1r1` gene is also expressed in their taste buds, confirming felines have all the necessary molecular machinery to detect umami[9][10].\n\n## Unique Mechanism of Feline Umami Receptors\n\nDespite having the required T1R1/T1R3 receptor, the way it functions in cats is markedly different from humans[11].\n\n*   **Human Umami Perception**: In humans, amino acids like L-glutamic acid (the primary component of MSG) and L-aspartic acid are the main agonists that activate the receptor[13]. Nucleotides, such as inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), act as potent enhancers, synergistically increasing the taste intensity[14][15].\n\n*   **Feline Umami Perception**: In cats, the roles are reversed due to mutations at critical binding sites on the T1R1 protein that recognize glutamic and aspartic acid in humans[9][11]. Consequently, the cat umami receptor does not respond to these amino acids when presented alone[10]. Instead, nucleotides (which are abundant in meat) act as the primary agonists that activate the receptor. Various L-amino acids then function as enhancers, amplifying the nucleotide-triggered signal[10][11]. This unique mechanism explains why cats are obsessed with tuna, as it contains particularly high concentrations of both IMP and L-histidine (an amino acid), a combination that strongly activates their umami receptors[11][5].\n\n## Behavioral Evidence and Dietary Preferences\n\nBehavioral studies corroborate the genetic and molecular findings, demonstrating that this specialized umami perception is a key driver of feline food choice[11].\n\n*   **Preference for Umami Compounds**: In a two-choice taste test, a panel of 25 cats showed a strong preference for water bowls containing combinations of nucleotides and amino acids that were found to activate their umami receptors most effectively[11][5].\n\n*   **Response to Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)**: Due to the unique mechanism of their receptors, cats do not show a significant preference for solutions of MSG alone when compared to water[16][17]. They may even avoid acidic amino acids like L-glutamic acid because of the sour taste rather than the umami flavor[16]. However, other research indicates that when added to cat foods, MSG and nucleotides can act synergistically to improve palatability[18]. While some studies have explored the metabolic effects of dietary MSG in cats, such as increased weight gain and reduced insulin sensitivity, these focus on physiological responses post-ingestion rather than taste-driven preference[19][20].",

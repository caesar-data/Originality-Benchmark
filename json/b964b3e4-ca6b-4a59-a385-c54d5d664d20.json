  "content": "**FALSE.** The statement that *Inception* is the highest-grossing film in Christopher Nolan's career is not supported by the provided data. While *Inception* was a major financial success, multiple sources confirm that at least two, and in some cases three, of his other films have earned more at the worldwide box office[1][2][3].\n\n## Comparative Box Office Performance\n\nAnalysis of Christopher Nolan's filmography reveals a consistent ranking where other films surpass *Inception* in total worldwide gross revenue.\n\n### Top-Grossing Nolan Films\nSeveral films directed by Christopher Nolan have grossed over $1 billion, placing them ahead of *Inception*.\n*   ***The Dark Knight Rises* (2012):** This film is consistently cited as Nolan's highest-grossing movie[1][2]. Reported earnings include **$1.081 billion**[1], **$1.082 billion**[2], and **$1.084 billion**[3].\n*   ***The Dark Knight* (2008):** Nolan's second Batman film is also his second-highest earner, and his first to cross the billion-dollar threshold[1][4]. Its box office totals are reported as **$1.006 billion**[1], **$1.004 billion**[5], and just under **$1 billion**[2].\n*   ***Oppenheimer* (2023):** Nolan's 2023 biographical film also grossed more than *Inception*, with reported worldwide earnings of **$960.4 million**[1] to **$972 million**[3].\n\n### Inception's Box Office Standing\n*Inception* (2010) was a significant commercial success, but its earnings place it behind the aforementioned films. Its worldwide gross is reported with slight variations across different sources:\n*   **$870.8 million**[1]\n*   **$839.8 million**[6][7]\n*   **$839.3 million**[8][9]\n*   **$839.03 million**[10]\n*   **$829.9 million**[5]\n*   **$828 million**[3]\n*   **$728.5 million**[2]\n\nThis performance typically ranks *Inception* as Nolan's third or fourth highest-grossing film of all time[1][3]. The film was made on a budget of $160 million and yielded a return on investment of over 424%[10].",

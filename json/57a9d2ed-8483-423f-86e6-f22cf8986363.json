  "content": "TRUE.\n\nSouth Korea has historically used three distinct systems to count a person's age, a practice that led to widespread confusion and prompted recent legislative reform [1][2]. As of June 28, 2023, a new law standardized the international age system for most legal and administrative purposes; however, one of the traditional methods remains in use for specific laws, and the most common traditional system persists in social and cultural contexts [3][4].\n\n## The Three Age-Counting Systems\n\nSouth Korea's complex approach to age has involved three different calculation methods, each with a specific name and application [5][6].\n\n### 1. International Age (`man-nai`)\nThis is the globally recognized standard where a person is zero years old at birth and gains one year on their birthday [1]. In Korean, it is called `man-nai` (\ub9cc \ub098\uc774), with \"man\" (\u6eff) meaning \"full\" or \"actual\" [8][9]. Since the early 1960s, South Korea has used this system for official legal and medical documents [10][11].\n\n### 2. Korean Age (`se-neun-nai`)\nKnown as `se-neun-nai` (\uc138\ub294 \ub098\uc774) or \"counting age,\" this is the most common traditional method used in everyday social life [12][8]. Under this system:\n*   A person is considered one year old at birth, with some theories suggesting this accounts for time spent in the womb [13][14][2].\n*   Everyone gains an additional year on January 1st, not on their birthday [15][3].\nThis means a baby born on December 31st is considered two years old the very next day [13][16].\n\n### 3. Calendar Age or Year Age (`yeon-nai`)\nThe third system is `yeon-nai` (\uc5f0 \ub098\uc774), or \"year age\" [8][12]. This method is a hybrid of the other two:\n*   A person is zero years old at birth, similar to the international system [13].\n*   They gain a year every January 1st, similar to the Korean age system [13][10].\nIt can also be calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year [1]. This system has been specifically used for certain legal purposes, such as determining the age for military conscription and the legal age to buy alcohol and tobacco [11][1].\n\n## Legal Unification and Current Status\n\nTo reduce \"unnecessary social and economic costs\" caused by the confusion, South Korea's National Assembly passed a law in December 2022 to standardize age counting [2][8]. The law took effect on June 28, 2023 [3][17].\n\n*   **Official Standard:** The law makes the **international age** (`man-nai`) the official standard for all administrative and civil matters, effectively scrapping the traditional `se-neun-nai` and `yeon-nai` systems from most official documents [18][19].\n*   **Social Persistence:** Despite the legal change, the traditional **Korean age** (`se-neun-nai`) continues to be used in everyday conversations and social interactions due to its deep cultural roots [4].\n*   **Legal Exceptions:** Crucially, the **calendar age** (`yeon-nai`) system will remain in use for the time being for specific purposes [10][11]. The new law does not affect regulations under the Military Service Act or the Juvenile Protection Act, which define eligibility for military service and the legal age for drinking and smoking based on the year of birth, not the specific birthday [3][20].\n\n## Illustrative Example\n\nThe simultaneous use of these systems means a single individual can have three different ages. For example, as of June 28, 2023, a person born on June 29, 2003, would be:\n*   **19** under the international system (their 20th birthday has not occurred yet) [13].\n*   **20** under the calendar/year age system (2023 minus 2003) [13].\n*   **21** under the traditional Korean age system (1 at birth + 20 years passed since birth year) [13].",
